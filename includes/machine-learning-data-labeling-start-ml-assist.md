ML assisted labeling starts automatically after some items have been labeled.  This automatic threshold varies by project.  However, you can manually start an ML assisted training run, as long as your project contains at least some labeled data.

> [!NOTE]
> On-demand training is not available for projects created before December, 2022.  Create a new project to use this feature.

Use the **Details** section to start a new ML assisted training run.

1. At the top of your project, select **Details**.
1. On the side navigation for **Details**, select **ML assisted labeling**
1. Scroll to the bottom if necessary and select **Start** for **On-demand training**
