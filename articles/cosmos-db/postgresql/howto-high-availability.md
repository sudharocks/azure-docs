# Configure high availability in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [PostgreSQL](../includes/appliesto-postgresql.md)]

Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL provides high availability
(HA) to avoid database downtime. With HA enabled, every node in a cluster
will get a standby. If the original node becomes unhealthy, its standby will be
promoted to replace it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because HA doubles the number of servers in the group, it will also double
> the cost.

Enabling HA is possible during cluster creation, or afterward in the
**Compute + storage** tab for your cluster in the Azure portal. The user
interface looks similar in either case. Drag the slider for **High
availability** from NO to YES:

Click the **Save** button to apply your selection. Enabling HA can take some
time as the cluster provisions standbys and streams data to them.

The **Overview** tab for the cluster will list all nodes and their
standbys, along with a **High availability** column indicating whether HA is
successfully enabled for each node.
