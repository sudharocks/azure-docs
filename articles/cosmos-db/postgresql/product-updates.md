# Product updates for Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [PostgreSQL](../includes/appliesto-postgresql.md)]

## Release notes

Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL gets updated regularly.

Updates that donâ€™t directly affect the internals of a cluster are rolled out gradually to [all supported regions](resources-regions.md). Once such an update is rolled out to a region, it's available immediately on all new and existing Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL clusters in that region.

Updates that change cluster internals, such as installing a [new minor PostgreSQL version](https://www.postgresql.org/developer/roadmap/), are delivered to existing clusters as part of the next [scheduled maintenance](concepts-maintenance.md) event. Such updates are available immediately to newly created clusters.

### January 2023

* General availability: 1- and 2-vCore [burstable compute](concepts-burstable-compute.md) options for single-node clusters (for dev/test and smaller workloads).
	* Available in all supported regions. See compute and storage details [here](resources-compute.md#single-node-cluster).

### December 2022

* General availability: Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL is now available in the Sweden Central and Switzerland West regions.
