# Supported metrics with Azure Monitor

> [!NOTE]
> This list is largely auto-generated. Any modification made to this list via GitHub might be written over without warning. Contact the author of this article for details on how to make permanent updates.

Date list was last updated: 02/01/2023.

Azure Monitor provides several ways to interact with metrics, including charting them in the Azure portal, accessing them through the REST API, or querying them by using PowerShell or the Azure CLI (Command Line Interface). 

This article is a complete list of all platform (that is, automatically collected) metrics currently available with the consolidated metric pipeline in Azure Monitor. Metrics changed or added after the date at the top of this article might not yet appear in the list. To query for and access the list of metrics programmatically, use the [2018-01-01 api-version](/rest/api/monitor/metricdefinitions). Other metrics not in this list might be available in the portal or through legacy APIs.

The metrics are organized by resource provider and resource type. For a list of services and the resource providers and types that belong to them, see [Resource providers for Azure services](../../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers.md).  

## Exporting platform metrics to other locations

You can export the platform metrics from the Azure monitor pipeline to other locations in one of two ways:

- Use the [metrics REST API](/rest/api/monitor/metrics/list).
- Use [diagnostic settings](../essentials/diagnostic-settings.md) to route platform metrics to: 
    - Azure Storage.
    - Azure Monitor Logs (and thus Log Analytics).
    - Event hubs, which is how you get them to non-Microsoft systems. 

Using diagnostic settings is the easiest way to route the metrics, but there are some limitations: 

- **Exportability**. All metrics are exportable through the REST API, but some can't be exported through diagnostic settings because of intricacies in the Azure Monitor back end. The column "Exportable via Diagnostic Settings" in the following tables lists which metrics can be exported in this way.  

- **Multi-dimensional metrics**. Sending multi-dimensional metrics to other locations via diagnostic settings is not currently supported. Metrics with dimensions are exported as flattened single-dimensional metrics, aggregated across dimension values. 

  For example, the *Incoming Messages* metric on an event hub can be explored and charted on a per-queue level. But when the metric is exported via diagnostic settings, it will be represented as all incoming messages across all queues in the event hub.

## Guest OS and host OS metrics

Metrics for the guest operating system (guest OS) that runs in Azure Virtual Machines, Service Fabric, and Cloud Services are *not* listed here. Guest OS metrics must be collected through one or more agents that run on or as part of the guest operating system. Guest OS metrics include performance counters that track guest CPU percentage or memory usage, both of which are frequently used for autoscaling or alerting. 

Host OS metrics *are* available and listed in the tables. Host OS metrics relate to the Hyper-V session that's hosting your guest OS session. 

> [!TIP]
> A best practice is to use and configure the Azure Monitor agent to send guest OS performance metrics into the same Azure Monitor metric database where platform metrics are stored. The agent routes guest OS metrics through the [custom metrics](../essentials/metrics-custom-overview.md) API. You can then chart, alert, and otherwise use guest OS metrics like platform metrics. 
>
> Alternatively or in addition, you can send the guest OS metrics to Azure Monitor Logs by using the same agent. There you can query on those metrics in combination with non-metric data by using Log Analytics. 

The Azure Monitor agent replaces the Azure Diagnostics extension and Log Analytics agent, which were previously used for guest OS routing. For important additional information, see [Overview of Azure Monitor agents](../agents/agents-overview.md).

## Table formatting

This latest update adds a new column and reorders the metrics to be alphabetical. The additional information means that the tables might have a horizontal scroll bar at the bottom, depending on the width of your browser window. If you seem to be missing information, use the scroll bar to see the entirety of the table.

|Metric|Exportable via Diagnostic Settings?|Metric Display Name|Unit|Aggregation Type|Description|Dimensions|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|\DirectoryServices(NTDS)\LDAP Searches/sec |Yes |NTDS - LDAP Searches/sec |CountPerSecond |Average |This metric indicates the average number of searches per second for the NTDS object. It is backed by performance counter data from the domain controller, and can be filtered or splitted by role instance. |DataCenter, Tenant, Role, RoleInstance, ScaleUnit |
|\DirectoryServices(NTDS)\LDAP Successful Binds/sec |Yes |NTDS - LDAP Successful Binds/sec |CountPerSecond |Average |This metric indicates the number of LDAP successful binds per second for the NTDS object. It is backed by performance counter data from the domain controller, and can be filtered or splitted by role instance. |DataCenter, Tenant, Role, RoleInstance, ScaleUnit |
|\DNS\Total Query Received/sec |Yes |DNS - Total Query Received/sec |CountPerSecond |Average |This metric indicates the average number of queries received by DNS server in each second. It is backed by performance counter data from the domain controller, and can be filtered or splitted by role instance. |DataCenter, Tenant, Role, RoleInstance, ScaleUnit |
|\DNS\Total Response Sent/sec |Yes |Total Response Sent/sec |CountPerSecond |Average |This metric indicates the average number of reponses sent by DNS server in each second. It is backed by performance counter data from the domain controller, and can be filtered or splitted by role instance. |DataCenter, Tenant, Role, RoleInstance, ScaleUnit |
|\Memory\% Committed Bytes In Use |Yes |% Committed Bytes In Use |Percent |Average |This metric indicates the ratio of Memory\Committed Bytes to the Memory\Commit Limit. Committed memory is the physical memory in use for which space has been reserved in the paging file should it need to be written to disk. The commit limit is determined by the size of the paging file. If the paging file is enlarged, the commit limit increases, and the ratio is reduced. This counter displays the current percentage value only; it is not an average. It is backed by performance counter data from the domain controller, and can be filtered or splitted by role instance. |DataCenter, Tenant, Role, RoleInstance, ScaleUnit |
|\Process(dns)\% Processor Time |Yes |% Processor Time (dns) |Percent |Average |This metric indicates the percentage of elapsed time that all of dns process threads used the processor to execute instructions. An instruction is the basic unit of execution in a computer, a thread is the object that executes instructions, and a process is the object created when a program is run. Code executed to handle some hardware interrupts and trap conditions are included in this count. It is backed by performance counter data from the domain controller, and can be filtered or splitted by role instance. |DataCenter, Tenant, Role, RoleInstance, ScaleUnit |
|\Process(lsass)\% Processor Time |Yes |% Processor Time (lsass) |Percent |Average |This metric indicates the percentage of elapsed time that all of lsass process threads used the processor to execute instructions. An instruction is the basic unit of execution in a computer, a thread is the object that executes instructions, and a process is the object created when a program is run. Code executed to handle some hardware interrupts and trap conditions are included in this count. It is backed by performance counter data from the domain controller, and can be filtered or splitted by role instance. |DataCenter, Tenant, Role, RoleInstance, ScaleUnit |
|\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time |Yes |Total Processor Time |Percent |Average |This metric indicates the percentage of elapsed time that the processor spends to execute a non-Idle thread. It is calculated by measuring the percentage of time that the processor spends executing the idle thread and then subtracting that value from 100%. (Each processor has an idle thread that consumes cycles when no other threads are ready to run). This counter is the primary indicator of processor activity, and displays the average percentage of busy time observed during the sample interval. It should be noted that the accounting calculation of whether the processor is idle is performed at an internal sampling interval of the system clock (10ms). On todays fast processors, % Processor Time can therefore underestimate the processor utilization as the processor may be spending a lot of time servicing threads between the system clock sampling interval. Workload based timer applications are one example  of applications  which are more likely to be measured inaccurately as timers are signaled just after the sample is taken. It is backed by performance counter data from the domain controller, and can be filtered or splitted by role instance. |DataCenter, Tenant, Role, RoleInstance, ScaleUnit |
|\Security System-Wide Statistics\Kerberos Authentications |Yes |Kerberos Authentications |CountPerSecond |Average |This metric indicates the number of times that clients use a ticket to authenticate to this computer per second. It is backed by performance counter data from the domain controller, and can be filtered or splitted by role instance. |DataCenter, Tenant, Role, RoleInstance, ScaleUnit |
|\Security System-Wide Statistics\NTLM Authentications |Yes |NTLM Authentications |CountPerSecond |Average |This metric indicates the number of NTLM authentications processed per second for the Active Directory on this domain contrller or for local accounts on this member server. It is backed by performance counter data from the domain controller, and can be filtered or splitted by role instance. |DataCenter, Tenant, Role, RoleInstance, ScaleUnit |
