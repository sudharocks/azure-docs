# Enable and configure SAP auditing for Microsoft Sentinel

This article shows you how to enable and configure auditing for the Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP, so that you can have complete visibility into your SAP solution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We strongly recommend that any management of your SAP system is carried out by an experienced SAP system administrator.
>
> The steps in this article may vary, depending on your SAP sytem's version, and should be considered as a sample only.

Some installations of SAP systems may not have audit log enabled by default. For best results in evaluating the performance and efficacy of the Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP, enable auditing of your SAP system and configure the audit parameters.

## Check if auditing is enabled

1. Sign in to the SAP GUI and run the **RSAU_CONFIG** transaction.

   ![Screenshot showing how to run the R S A U CONFIG transaction.](./media/configure-audit/rsau-config.png)

1. In the **Security Audit Log - Display of Current Configuration** window, find the **Parameter** section within the **Configuration** section. Under **General Parameters**, see that the **Static security audit active** checkbox is marked.

## Enable auditing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your audit policy should be determined in close collaboration with SAP administrators and your security department.

1. Sign in to the SAP GUI and run the **RSAU_CONFIG** transaction.

1. In the **Security Audit Log** screen, select **Parameter** under **Security Audit Log Configuration** section in **Configuration** tree.

1. If the **Static security audit active** checkbox is marked, system-level auditing is turned on. If it isn't, select **Display <-> Change** and mark the **Static security audit active** checkbox. 

1. By default, the SAP system logs the client name (terminal ID) rather than client IP address. If you want the system to log by client IP address instead, mark the **Log peer address not terminal ID** checkbox in the **General Parameters** section.

1. If you changed any settings in the **Security Audit Log Configuration - Parameter** section, select **Save** to save the changes. Auditing will be activated only after the server is rebooted.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > SAP applications running on Windows OS should consider recommendations in SAP Note 2360334 in case the audit log isn't read correctly after setup.

1. Right-click **Static Configuration** and select **Create Profile**.

1. Specify a name for the profile in the **Profile/Filter Number** field.

1. Mark the **Filter for recording active** checkbox.

1. In the **Client** field, enter `*`.

1. In the **User** field enter `*`.

1. Under **Event Selection**, choose **Classic event selection** and select all the event types in the list. 

    Alternatively, choose **Detail event selection**, review the list of message IDs listed in the [Recommended audit categories](#recommended-audit-categories) section of this article, and configure them in **Detail event selection**.

1. Select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot showing Static profile settings.](./media/configure-audit/create-profile-settings.png)

1. You'll see that the **Static Configuration** section displays the newly created profile. Right-click the profile and select **Activate**.

1. In the confirmation window select **Yes** to activate the newly created profile.

### Recommended audit categories

The following table lists Message IDs used by the Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP. In order for analytics rules to detect events properly, we strongly recommend configuring an audit policy that includes the message IDs listed below as a minimum.
