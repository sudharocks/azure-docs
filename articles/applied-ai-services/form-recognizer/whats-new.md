## March 2021

 **Form Recognizer v2.1 public preview v2.1-preview.3 has been released and includes the following features:**

* **New prebuilt ID model** The new prebuilt ID model enables customers to take IDs and return structured data to automate processing. It combines our powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities with ID understanding models to extract key information from passports and U.S. driver licenses.

  [Learn more about the prebuilt ID model](./concept-id-document.md)

   :::image type="content" source="./media/id-canada-passport-example.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a sample passport." lightbox="./media/id-canada-passport-example.png":::

* **Line-item extraction for invoice model** - Prebuilt Invoice model now supports line item extraction; it now extracts full items and their parts - description, amount, quantity, product ID, date and more. With a simple API/SDK call, you can extract useful data from your invoices - text, table, key-value pairs, and line items.

   [Learn more about the invoice model](./concept-invoice.md)

* **Supervised table labeling and training, empty-value labeling** - In addition to Form Recognizer's [state-of-the-art deep learning automatic table extraction capabilities](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai/enhanced-table-extraction-from-documents-with-form-recognizer/ba-p/2058011), it now enables customers to label and train on tables. This new release includes the ability to label and train on line items/tables (dynamic and fixed) and train a custom model to extract key-value pairs and line items. Once a model is trained, the model will extract line items as part of the JSON output in the documentResults section.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/table-labeling.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the table labeling feature." lightbox="./media/table-labeling.png":::

    In addition to labeling tables, you can now label empty values and regions. If some documents in your training set don't have values for certain fields, you can label them so that your model will know to extract values properly from analyzed documents.

* **Support for 66 new languages** - The Layout API and Custom Models for Form Recognizer now support 73 languages.

  [Learn more about Form Recognizer's language support](language-support.md)

* **Natural reading order, handwriting classification, and page selection** - With this update, you can choose to get the text line outputs in the natural reading order instead of the default left-to-right and top-to-bottom ordering. Use the new readingOrder query parameter and set it to "natural" value for a more human-friendly reading order output. In addition, for Latin languages, Form Recognizer will classify text lines as handwritten style or not and give a confidence score.

* **Prebuilt receipt model quality improvements** This update includes many quality improvements for the prebuilt Receipt model, especially around line item extraction.

---

## November 2020

* **Form Recognizer v2.1-preview.2 has been released and includes the following features:**

## April 2020

* **SDK support for Form Recognizer API v2.0 Public Preview** - This month we expanded our service support to include a preview SDK for Form Recognizer v2.0  release. Use these links to get started with your language of choice:
* [.NET SDK](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.formrecognizer-readme)
* [Java SDK](/java/api/overview/azure/ai-formrecognizer-readme)
* [Python SDK](/python/api/overview/azure/ai-formrecognizer-readme)
* [JavaScript SDK](/javascript/api/overview/azure/ai-form-recognizer-readme)

The new SDK supports all the features of the v2.0 REST API for Form Recognizer. You can share your feedback on the SDKs through the [SDK Feedback form](https://aka.ms/FR_SDK_v1_feedback).

* **Copy Custom Model** You can now copy models between regions and subscriptions using the new Copy Custom Model feature. Before invoking the Copy Custom Model API, you must first obtain authorization to copy into the target resource. This authorization is secured by calling the Copy Authorization operation against the target resource endpoint.

* [Generate a copy authorization](https://westus2.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2/operations/CopyCustomFormModelAuthorization) REST API
* [Copy a custom model](https://westus2.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v2/operations/CopyCustomFormModel) REST API

* Security improvements

* Customer-Managed Keys are now available for FormRecognizer. For more information, see [Data encryption at rest for Form Recognizer](./encrypt-data-at-rest.md).
* Use Managed Identities for access to Azure resources with Azure Active Directory. For more information, see [Authorize access to managed identities](../../cognitive-services/authentication.md#authorize-access-to-managed-identities).

## March 2020

* **Value types for labeling** You can now specify the types of values you're labeling with the Form Recognizer Sample Labeling tool. The following value types and variations are currently supported:
* `string`
  * default, `no-whitespaces`, `alphanumeric`
* `number`
  * default, `currency`
* `date`
  * default, `dmy`, `mdy`, `ymd`
* `time`
* `integer`

See the [Sample Labeling tool](label-tool.md#specify-tag-value-types) guide to learn how to use this feature.

* **Table visualization** The Sample Labeling tool now displays tables that were recognized in the document. This feature lets you view recognized and extracted tables from the document prior to labeling and analyzing. This feature can be toggled on/off using the layers option.

* The following image is an example of how tables are recognized and extracted:

    :::image type="content" source="media/whats-new/table-viz.png" alt-text="Screenshot of table visualization using the Sample Labeling tool.":::

* The extracted tables are available in the JSON output under `"pageResults"`.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Labeling tables isn't supported. If tables are not recognized and extracted automatically, you can only label them as key/value pairs. When labeling tables as key/value pairs, label each cell as a unique value.

* Extraction enhancements

* This release includes extraction enhancements and accuracy improvements, specifically, the capability to label and extract multiple key/value pairs in the same line of text.

* Sample Labeling tool is now open-source

* The Form Recognizer Sample Labeling tool is now available as an open-source project. You can integrate it within your solutions and make customer-specific changes to meet your needs.

* For more information about the Form Recognizer Sample Labeling tool, review the documentation available on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/OCR-Form-Tools/blob/master/README.md).

## January 2020

This release introduces the Form Recognizer 2.0. In the next sections, you'll find more information about new features, enhancements, and changes.

* New features

  * **Custom model**
    * **Train with labels** You can now train a custom model with manually labeled data. This method results in better-performing models and can produce models that work with complex forms or forms containing values without keys.
    * **Asynchronous API** You can use async API calls to train with and analyze large data sets and files.
    * **TIFF file support** You can now train with and extract data from TIFF documents.
    * **Extraction accuracy improvements**

  * **Prebuilt receipt model**
    * **Tip amounts** You can now extract tip amounts and other handwritten values.
    * **Line item extraction** You can extract line item values from receipts.
    * **Confidence values** You can view the model's confidence for each extracted value.
    * **Extraction accuracy improvements**

  * **Layout extraction** You can now use the Layout API to extract text data and table data from your forms.

* Custom model API changes

  All of the APIs for training and using custom models have been renamed, and some synchronous methods are now asynchronous. The following are major changes:

  * The process of training a model is now asynchronous. You initiate training through the **/custom/models** API call. This call returns an operation ID, which you can pass into **custom/models/{modelID}** to return the training results.
  * Key/value extraction is now initiated by the **/custom/models/{modelID}/analyze** API call. This call returns an operation ID, which you can pass into **custom/models/{modelID}/analyzeResults/{resultID}** to return the extraction results.
  * Operation IDs for the Train operation are now found in the **Location** header of HTTP responses, not the **Operation-Location** header.

* Receipt API changes

  * The APIs for reading sales receipts have been renamed.

  * Receipt data extraction is now initiated by the **/prebuilt/receipt/analyze** API call. This call returns an operation ID, which you can pass into **/prebuilt/receipt/analyzeResults/{resultID}** to return the extraction results.

* Output format changes

  * The JSON responses for all API calls have new formats. Some keys and values have been added, removed, or renamed. See the quickstarts for examples of the current JSON formats.
