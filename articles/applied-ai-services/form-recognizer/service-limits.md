## Detailed description, Quota adjustment, and best practices

Before requesting a quota increase (where applicable), ensure that it's necessary. Form Recognizer service uses autoscaling to bring the required computational resources in "on-demand"  and at the same time to keep the customer costs low, deprovision unused resources by not maintaining an excessive amount of hardware capacity.

If your application returns Response Code 429 (*Too many requests*) and your workload is within the defined limits: most likely, the service is scaling up to your demand, but hasn't yet reached the required scale. Thus the service doesn't immediately have enough resources to serve the request. This state is transient and shouldn't last long. For more information, *see* [Quotas and Limits quick reference](#form-recognizer-service-quotas-and-limits))

### General best practices to mitigate throttling during autoscaling

To minimize issues related to throttling (Response Code 429), we recommend using the following techniques:

* Implement retry logic in your application
* Avoid sharp changes in the workload. Increase the workload gradually <br/>
*Example.* Your application is using Form Recognizer and your current workload is 10 TPS (transactions per second). The next second you increase the load to 40 TPS (that is four times more). The Service immediately starts scaling up to fulfill the new load, but likely it will not be able to do it within a second, so some of the requests will get Response Code 429.

The next sections describe specific cases of adjusting quotas.
Jump to [Form Recognizer: increasing concurrent request limit](#create-and-submit-support-request)

### Increasing transactions per second request limit

By default the number of transactions per second is limited to 15 transactions per second for a Form Recognizer resource. For the Standard pricing tier, this amount can be increased. Before submitting the request, ensure you're familiar with the material in [this section](#detailed-description-quota-adjustment-and-best-practices) and aware of these [best practices](#example-of-a-workload-pattern-best-practice).

Increasing the Concurrent Request limit does **not** directly affect your costs. Form Recognizer service uses "Pay only for what you use" model. The limit defines how high the Service may scale before it starts throttle your requests.

Existing value of Concurrent Request limit parameter is **not** visible via Azure portal, Command-Line tools, or API requests. To verify the existing value, create an Azure Support Request.

If you would like to increase your transactions per second, you can enable auto scaling on your resource. Follow this document to enable auto scaling on your resource * [enable auto scaling](../../cognitive-services/autoscale.md). You can also submit an increase TPS support request.

#### Have the required information ready

* Form Recognizer Resource ID
* Region

* **How to get information (Base model)**:
  * Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
  * Select the Form Recognizer Resource for which you would like to increase the transaction limit
  * Select *Properties* (*Resource Management* group)
  * Copy and save the values of the following fields:
    * **Resource ID**
    * **Location** (your endpoint Region)

#### Create and submit support request

Initiate the increase of transactions per second(TPS) limit for your resource by submitting the Support Request:

* Ensure you have the [required information](#have-the-required-information-ready)
* Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
* Select the Form Recognizer Resource for which you would like to increase the TPS limit
* Select *New support request* (*Support + troubleshooting* group)
* A new window will appear with auto-populated information about your Azure Subscription and Azure Resource
* Enter *Summary* (like "Increase Form Recognizer TPS limit")
* In Problem type,* select "Quota or usage validation"
* Select *Next: Solutions*
* Proceed further with the request creation
* Under the *Details* tab enters the following in the *Description* field:
  * a note, that the request is about **Form Recognizer** quota.
  * Provide a TPS expectation you would like to scale to  meet.
  * Azure resource information you [collected](#have-the-required-information-ready).
  * Complete entering the required information and select *Create* button in *Review + create* tab
  * Note the support request number in Azure portal notifications. You'll be contacted shortly for further processing

## Example of a workload pattern best practice

This example presents the approach we recommend following to mitigate possible request throttling due to [Autoscaling being in progress](#detailed-description-quota-adjustment-and-best-practices). It isn't an "exact recipe", but merely a template we invite to follow and adjust as necessary.

 Let us suppose that a Form Recognizer resource has the default limit set. Start the workload to submit your analyze requests. If you find that you're seeing frequent throttling with response code 429, start by implementing an exponential backoff on the GET analyze response request. By using a progressively longer wait time between retries for consecutive error responses, for example a  2-5-13-34 pattern of delays between requests. In general, it's recommended to not call the get analyze response more than once every 2 seconds for a corresponding POST request.

If you find that you're being throttled on the number of POST requests for documents being submitted, consider adding a delay between the requests. If your workload requires a higher degree of concurrent processing, you'll then need to create a support request to increase your service limits on transactions per second.

Generally, it's highly recommended to test the workload and the workload patterns before going to production.
