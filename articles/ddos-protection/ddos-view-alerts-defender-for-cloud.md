# View Azure DDoS Protection alerts in Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides a list of [security alerts](../security-center/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts.md), with information to help investigate and remediate problems. With this feature, you get a unified view of alerts, including DDoS attack-related alerts and the actions taken to mitigate the attack in near-time.
There are two specific alerts that you'll see for any DDoS attack detection and mitigation:

- **DDoS Attack detected for Public IP**: This alert is generated when the DDoS protection service detects that one of your public IP addresses is the target of a DDoS attack.
- **DDoS Attack mitigated for Public IP**: This alert is generated when an attack on the public IP address has been mitigated.
To view the alerts, open **Defender for Cloud** in the Azure portal and select **Security alerts**. Under **Threat Protection**, select **Security alerts**. The following screenshot shows an example of the DDoS attack alerts.
