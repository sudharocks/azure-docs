# Delete a Lifecycle workflow (Preview)

You can remove workflows that are no longer needed. Deleting these workflows allows you to make sure your lifecycle strategy is up to date. When a workflow is deleted, it enters a soft delete state. During this period, it's still able to be viewed within the deleted workflows list, and can be restored if needed. 30 days after a workflow enters a soft delete state it will be permanently removed. If you don't wish to wait 30 days for a workflow to permanently delete you can always manually delete it yourself.

## Prerequisites
