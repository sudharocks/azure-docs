# Manage workflow properties (preview)

Managing workflows can be accomplished in one of two ways.  
   - Updating the basic properties of a workflow without creating a new version of it
   - Creating a new version of the updated workflow. 

You can update the following basic information without creating a new workflow.
   - display name
   - description
   - whether or not it is enabled.
   - Whether or not workflow schedule is enabled.

If you change any other parameters, a new version is required to be created as outlined in the [Managing workflow versions](manage-workflow-tasks.md) article. 

If done via the Azure portal, the new version is created automatically. If done using Microsoft Graph, you will have to manually create a new version of the workflow.  For more information, see [Edit the properties of a workflow using Microsoft Graph](#edit-the-properties-of-a-workflow-using-microsoft-graph).

## Edit the properties of a workflow using the Azure portal
