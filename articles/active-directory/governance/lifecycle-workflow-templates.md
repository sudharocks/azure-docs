# Lifecycle Workflows templates (Preview)


Lifecycle Workflows allows you to automate the lifecycle management process for your organization by creating workflows that contain both built-in tasks, and custom task extensions. These workflows, and the tasks within them, all fall into categories based on the Joiner-Mover-Leaver(JML) model of lifecycle management. To make this process even more efficient, Lifecycle Workflows also provide you templates, which you can use to accelerate the set up, creation, and configuration of common lifecycle management processes. You can create workflows based on these templates as is, or you can customize them even further to match the requirements for users within your organization. In this article you'll get the complete list of workflow templates, common template parameters, default template parameters for specific templates, and the list of compatible tasks for each template. For full task definitions, see [Lifecycle Workflow tasks and definitions](lifecycle-workflow-tasks.md).


## Lifecycle Workflow Templates

Lifecycle Workflows currently have six built-in templates you can use or customize:
