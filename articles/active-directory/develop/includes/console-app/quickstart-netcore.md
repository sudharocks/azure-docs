#Customer intent: As an application developer, I want to learn how my .NET Core app can get an access token and call an API that's protected by the Microsoft identity platform by using the client credentials flow.
---

The following quickstart uses a code sample to demonstrates how a .NET Core console application can get an access token to call the Microsoft Graph API and display a [list of users](/graph/api/user-list) in the directory. It also demonstrates how a job or a Windows service can run with an application identity, instead of a user's identity. The sample console application in this quickstart is also a daemon application, therefore it's a confidential client application.

The following diagram shows how the sample app works:

## Prerequisites

This quickstart requires [.NET Core 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

## Register and download the app

The application can be built using either an automatic or manual configuration.

### Automatic configuration

To register and automatically configure the app and then download the code sample, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Azure portal page for app registration](https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps=true#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/applicationsListBlade/quickStartType/DotNetCoreDaemonQuickstartPage/sourceType/docs).
1. Enter a name for your application and select **Register**.
1. Follow the instructions to download and automatically configure your new application in one click.

### Manual configuration

To manually configure your application and code sample, use the following procedures.

#### Step 1: Register your application

To register the application and add the registration information to the solution manually, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. If access to multiple tenants is available, use the **Directories + subscriptions** filter :::image type="icon" source="../../media/common/portal-directory-subscription-filter.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which to register the application.
1. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **App registrations** > **New registration**.
1. For **Name**, enter a name for the application. For example, enter **Daemon-console**. Users of the app will see this name, and can be changed later.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Certificates & secrets**.
1. Under **Client secrets**, select **New client secret**, enter a name, and then select **Add**. Record the secret value in a safe location for use in a later step.
1. Under **Manage**, select **API Permissions** > **Add a permission**. Select **Microsoft Graph**.
1. Select **Application permissions**.
1. Under the **User** node, select **User.Read.All**, and then select **Add permissions**.

#### Step 2: Download your Visual Studio project

[Download the Visual Studio project](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2/archive/master.zip)

This project can be run in either Visual Studio or Visual Studio for Mac and can be downloaded from the [code sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2/archive/master.zip).

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-develop-path-length-tip](../../../../../includes/active-directory-develop-path-length-tip.md)]

#### Step 3: Configure your Visual Studio project

1. Extract the *.zip* file to a local folder that's close to the root of the disk to avoid errors caused by path length limitations on Windows. For example, extract to *C:\Azure-Samples*.

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio: *1-Call-MSGraph\daemon-console.sln* (optional).
1. In *appsettings.json*, replace the values of `Tenant`, `ClientId`, and `ClientSecret`. The value for the application (client) ID and the directory (tenant) ID, can be found in the app's **Overview** page on the Azure portal.

   ```json
   "Tenant": "Enter_the_Tenant_Id_Here",
   "ClientId": "Enter_the_Application_Id_Here",
   "ClientSecret": "Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here"
   ```

   In the code:
   - `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` is the application (client) ID for the registered application.
   - Replace `Enter_the_Tenant_Id_Here` with the tenant ID or tenant name (for example, `contoso.microsoft.com`).
   - Replace `Enter_the_Client_Secret_Here` with the client secret that you created in step 1.
    To generate a new key, go to the **Certificates & secrets** page.

#### Step 4: Admin consent

Running the application now results in the output `HTTP 403 - Forbidden* error: "Insufficient privileges to complete the operation`. This error occurs because any app-only permission requires a global administrator of the directory to give consent to the application. Select one of the following options, depending on the role.

##### Global tenant administrator

For a global tenant administrator, go to **Enterprise applications** in the Azure portal. Select the app registration, and select **Permissions** from the **Security** section of the left pane. Then select the large button labeled **Grant admin consent for {Tenant Name}** (where **{Tenant Name}** is the name of the directory).

##### Standard user

For a standard user of your tenant, ask a global administrator to grant admin consent to the application. To do this, provide the following URL to the administrator:

```url
https://login.microsoftonline.com/Enter_the_Tenant_Id_Here/adminconsent?client_id=Enter_the_Application_Id_Here
```

In the URL:

- Replace `Enter_the_Tenant_Id_Here` with the tenant ID or tenant name (for example, `contoso.microsoft.com`).
- `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` is the application (client) ID for the registered application.

The error `AADSTS50011: No reply address is registered for the application` may be displayed after you grant consent to the app by using the preceding URL. This error occurs because the application and the URL don't have a redirect URI. This can be ignored.

#### Step 5: Run the application

In Visual Studio, press **F5** to run the application. Otherwise, run the application via command prompt, console, or terminal:

```dotnetcli
cd {ProjectFolder}\1-Call-MSGraph\daemon-console
dotnet run
```

In that code:

- `{ProjectFolder}` is the folder where you extracted the .zip file. An example is `C:\Azure-Samples\active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2`.

A list of users in Azure Active Directory should be displayed as a result.

This quickstart application uses a client secret to identify itself as a confidential client. The client secret is added as a plain-text file to the project files. For security reasons, it is recommended to use a certificate instead of a client secret before considering the application as a production application. For more information on how to use a certificate, see [these instructions](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2/#variation-daemon-application-using-client-credentials-with-certificates).

## More information

This section provides an overview of the code required to sign in users. The overview can be useful to understand how the code works, what the main arguments are, and how to add sign-in to an existing .NET Core console application.

### MSAL.NET

Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL, in the [Microsoft.Identity.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Client) package) is the library that's used to sign in users and request tokens for accessing an API protected by the Microsoft identity platform. This quickstart requests tokens by using the application's own identity instead of delegated permissions. The authentication flow in this case is known as a [client credentials OAuth flow](../../v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md). For more information on how to use MSAL.NET with a client credentials flow, see [this article](https://aka.ms/msal-net-client-credentials).

 MSAL.NET can be installed by running the following command in the Visual Studio Package Manager Console:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.Identity.Client
```

### MSAL initialization

Add the reference for MSAL by adding the following code:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
```

Then, initialize MSAL with the following:

```csharp
IConfidentialClientApplication app;
app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config.ClientId)
                                          .WithClientSecret(config.ClientSecret)
                                          .WithAuthority(new Uri(config.Authority))
                                          .Build();
```

 | Element | Description |
 |---------|---------|
 | `config.ClientSecret` | The client secret created for the application in the Azure portal. |
 | `config.ClientId` | The application (client) ID for the application registered in the Azure portal. You can find this value on the app's **Overview** page in the Azure portal. |
 | `config.Authority`    | (Optional) The security token service (STS) endpoint for the user to authenticate. It's usually `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}` for the public cloud, where `{tenant}` is the name of your tenant or your tenant ID.|

For more information, see the [reference documentation for `ConfidentialClientApplication`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.iconfidentialclientapplication).

### Requesting tokens

To request a token by using the app's identity, use the `AcquireTokenForClient` method:

```csharp
result = await app.AcquireTokenForClient(scopes)
                  .ExecuteAsync();
```

|Element| Description |
|---------|---------|
| `scopes` | Contains the requested scopes. For confidential clients, this value should use a format similar to `{Application ID URI}/.default`. This format indicates that the requested scopes are the ones that are statically defined in the app object set in the Azure portal. For Microsoft Graph, `{Application ID URI}` points to `https://graph.microsoft.com`. For custom web APIs, `{Application ID URI}` is defined in the Azure portal, under **Application Registration (Preview)** > **Expose an API**. |

For more information, see the [reference documentation for `AcquireTokenForClient`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.confidentialclientapplication.acquiretokenforclient).
