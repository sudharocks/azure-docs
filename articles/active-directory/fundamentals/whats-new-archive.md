### Public Preview - Azure AD Domain Services - Trusts for User Forests

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Domain Services  
**Product capability:** Azure AD Domain Services  
 

You can now create trusts on both user and resource forests. On-premises AD DS users can't authenticate to resources in the Azure AD DS resource forest until you create an outbound trust to your on-premises AD DS. An outbound trust requires network connectivity to your on-premises virtual network on which you have installed Azure AD Domain Service. On a user forest, trusts can be created for on-premises AD forests that aren't synchronized to Azure AD DS.

To learn more about trusts and how to deploy your own, visit [How trust relationships work for forests in Active Directory](../../active-directory-domain-services/concepts-forest-trust.md).

###  General Availability – Protect against by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** MS Graph  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection  
 

We're delighted to announce a new security protection that prevents bypassing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD. When enabled for a federated domain in your Azure AD tenant, it ensures that a compromised federated account can't bypass Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication by imitating that a multi factor authentication has already been performed by the identity provider. The protection can be enabled via new security setting, [federatedIdpMfaBehavior](/graph/api/resources/internaldomainfederation?view=graph-rest-beta#federatedidpmfabehavior-values&preserve-view=true).

 
We highly recommend enabling this new protection when using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication as your multi factor authentication for your federated users. To learn more about the protection and how to enable it, visit [Enable protection to prevent by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#enable-protection-to-prevent-by-passing-of-cloud-azure-ad-multi-factor-authentication-when-federated-with-azure-ad).

###  Public Preview – Protect against by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** MS Graph  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection  


We're delighted to announce a new security protection that prevents bypassing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD. When enabled for a federated domain in your Azure AD tenant, it ensures that a compromised federated account can't bypass Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication by imitating that a multi factor authentication has already been performed by the identity provider. The protection can be enabled via new security setting, [federatedIdpMfaBehavior](/graph/api/resources/internaldomainfederation?view=graph-rest-beta#federatedidpmfabehavior-values&preserve-view=true). 

We highly recommend enabling this new protection when using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication as your multi factor authentication for your federated users. To learn more about the protection and how to enable it, visit [Enable protection to prevent by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#enable-protection-to-prevent-by-passing-of-cloud-azure-ad-multi-factor-authentication-when-federated-with-azure-ad).

### Pre-authentication error events removed from Azure AD Sign-in Logs

**Type:** Deprecated  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting  
 
We're no longer publishing sign-in logs with the following error codes because these events are pre-authentication events that occur before our service has authenticated a user. Because these events happen before authentication, our service isn't always able to correctly identify the user. If a user continues on to authenticate, the user sign-in will show up in your tenant Sign-in logs. These logs are no longer visible in the Azure portal UX, and querying these error codes in the Graph API will no longer return results.

|Error code | Failure reason|
| --- | --- |
|50058| Session information isn't sufficient for single-sign-on.|
|16000| Either multiple user identities are available for the current request or selected account isn't supported for the scenario.|
|500581| Rendering JavaScript. Fetching sessions for single-sign-on on V2 with prompt=none requires JavaScript to verify if any MSA accounts are signed in.|
|81012| The user trying to sign in to Azure AD is different from the user signed into the device.|

## November 2021

### Tenant enablement of combined security information registration for Azure Active Directory

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

### Windows users will see prompts more often when switching user accounts

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
A problematic interaction between Windows and a local Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) instance can result in users attempting to sign into another account, but be silently signed into their existing account instead, with no warning. For federated IdPs such as ADFS, that support the [prompt=login](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/ad-fs-prompt-login) pattern, Azure AD will now trigger a fresh sign-in at ADFS when a user is directed to ADFS with a sign-in hint. This ensures that the user is signed into the account they requested, rather than being silently signed into the account they're already signed in with. 

For more information, see the [change notice](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md).

## October 2021
 
### Limits on the number of configured API permissions for an application registration will be enforced starting in October 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
Sometimes, application developers configure their apps to require more permissions than it's possible to grant. To prevent this from happening, a limit on the total number of required permissions that can be configured for an app registration will be enforced.

The total number of required permissions for any single application registration mustn't exceed 400 permissions, across all APIs. The change to enforce this limit will begin rolling out mid-October 2021. Applications exceeding the limit can't increase the number of permissions they're configured for. The existing limit on the number of distinct APIs for which permissions are required remains unchanged and may not exceed 50 APIs.

In the Azure portal, the required permissions are listed under API permissions for the application you wish to configure. Using Microsoft Graph or Microsoft Graph PowerShell, the required permissions are listed in the requiredResourceAccess property of an [application](/graph/api/resources/application) entity. [Learn more](../enterprise-users/directory-service-limits-restrictions.md).

### Email one-time passcode on by default change beginning rollout in November 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 
Previously, we announced that starting October 31, 2021, Microsoft Azure Active Directory [email one-time passcode](../external-identities/one-time-passcode.md) authentication will become the default method for inviting accounts and tenants for B2B collaboration scenarios. However, because of deployment schedules, we'll begin rolling out on November 1, 2021. Most of the tenants will see the change rolled out in January 2022 to minimize disruptions during the holidays and deployment lock downs. After this change, Microsoft will no longer allow redemption of invitations using Azure Active Directory accounts that are unmanaged. [Learn more](../external-identities/one-time-passcode.md#frequently-asked-questions).
 
---

### Conditional Access Guest Access Blocking Screen

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Conditional Access  
**Product capability:** End User Experiences
 
If there's no trust relation between a home and resource tenant, a guest user would have previously been asked to re-register their device, which would break the previous registration. However, the user would end up in a registration loop because only home tenant device registration is supported. In this specific scenario, instead of this loop, we've created a new conditional access blocking page. The page tells the end user that they can't get access to conditional access protected resources as a guest user. [Learn more](../external-identities/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal.md#prerequisites).
 
---

### 50105 Errors will now result in a UX error message instead of an error response to the application

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
Azure AD has fixed a bug in an error response that occurs when a user isn't assigned to an app that requires a user assignment. Previously, Azure AD would return error 50105 with the OIDC error code "interaction_required" even during interactive authentication. This would cause well-coded applications to loop indefinitely, as they do interactive authentication and receive an error telling them to do interactive authentication, which they would then do.  

The bug has been fixed, so that during non-interactive auth an "interaction_required" error will still be returned. Also, during interactive authentication an error page will be directly displayed to the user.  

For greater details, see the change notices for [Azure AD protocols](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#error-50105-has-been-fixed-to-not-return-interaction_required-during-interactive-authentication).

### Public preview - New claims transformation capabilities

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Enterprise Apps  
**Product capability:** SSO
 
The following new capabilities have been added to the claims transformations available for manipulating claims in tokens issued from Azure AD:
 
- Join() on NameID. Used to be restricted to joining an email format address with a verified domain. Now Join() can be used on the NameID claim in the same way as any other claim, so NameID transforms can be used to create Windows account style NameIDs or any other string. For now if the result is an email address, the Azure AD will still validate that the domain is one that is verified in the tenant.
- Substring(). A new transformation in the claims configuration UI allows extraction of defined position substrings such as five characters starting at character three - substring(3,5)
- Claims transformations. These transformations can now be performed on Multi-valued attributes, and can emit multi-valued claims. Microsoft Graph can now be used to read/write multi-valued directory schema extension attributes. [Learn more](../develop/active-directory-saml-claims-customization.md).

### General availability - Google deprecation of Gmail sign-in support on embedded webviews on September 30, 2021

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 
Google has deprecated Gmail sign-ins on Microsoft Teams mobile and custom apps that run Gmail authentications on embedded webviews on Sept. 30th, 2021.

If you would like to request an extension, impacted customers with affected OAuth client ID(s) should have received an email from Google Developers with the following information regarding a one-time policy enforcement extension, which must be completed by Jan 31, 2022.

To continue allowing your Gmail users to sign in and redeem, we strongly recommend that you refer to [Embedded vs System Web](../develop/msal-net-web-browsers.md#embedded-vs-system-web-ui) UI in the MSAL.NET documentation and modify your apps to use the system browser for sign-in. All MSAL SDKs use the system web-view by default. 

As a workaround, we're deploying the device sign-in flow by October 8. Between today and until then, it's likely that it may not be rolled out to all regions yet (in which case, end-users will be met with an error screen until it gets deployed to your region.) 

For more details on the device sign-in flow and details on requesting extension to Google, see [Add Google as an identity provider for B2B guest users](../external-identities/google-federation.md#deprecation-of-web-view-sign-in-support).

## September 2021

### Limits on the number of configured API permissions for an application registration will be enforced starting in October 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
Occasionally, application developers configure their apps to require more permissions than it's possible to grant. To prevent this from happening, we're enforcing a limit on the total number of required permissions that can be configured for an app registration.

The total number of required permissions for any single application registration must not exceed 400 permissions, across all APIs. The change to enforce this limit will begin rolling out no sooner than mid-October 2021. Applications exceeding the limit can't increase the number of permissions they're configured for. The existing limit on the number of distinct APIs for which permissions are required remains unchanged and can't exceed 50 APIs.

In the Azure portal, the required permissions are listed under Azure Active Directory > Application registrations > (select an application) > API permissions. Using Microsoft Graph or Microsoft Graph PowerShell, the required permissions are listed in the requiredResourceAccess property of an application entity. [Learn more](../enterprise-users/directory-service-limits-restrictions.md).

### Single Page Apps using the `spa` redirect URI type must use a CORS enabled browser for auth

**Type:** Known issue  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
The modern Edge browser is now included in the requirement to provide an `Origin` header when redeeming a [single page app authorization code](../develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow.md#redirect-uris-for-single-page-apps-spas). A compatibility fix accidentally exempted the modern Edge browser from CORS controls, and that bug is being fixed during October. A subset of applications depended on CORS being disabled in the browser, which has the side effect of removing the `Origin` header from traffic. This is an unsupported configuration for using Azure AD, and these apps that depended on disabling CORS can no longer use modern Edge as a security workaround.  All modern browsers must now include the `Origin` header per HTTP spec, to ensure CORS is enforced. [Learn more](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#the-device-code-flow-ux-will-now-include-an-app-confirmation-prompt).

## July 2021

### New Google sign-in integration for Azure AD B2C and B2B self-service sign-up and invited external users will stop working starting July 12, 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 
Previously we announced that [the exception for Embedded WebViews for Gmail authentication will expire in the second half of 2021](https://www.yammer.com/cepartners/threads/1188371962232832).

On July 7, 2021, we learned from Google that some of these restrictions will apply starting **July 12, 2021**. Azure AD B2B and B2C customers who set up a new Google ID sign-in in their custom or line of business applications to invite external users or enable self-service sign-up will have the restrictions applied immediately. As a result, end-users will be met with an error screen that blocks their Gmail sign-in if the authentication is not moved to a system webview. See the docs linked below for details. 

Most apps use system web-view by default, and will not be impacted by this change. This only applies to customers using embedded webviews (the non-default setting.) We advise customers to move their application's authentication to system browsers instead, prior to creating any new Google integrations. To learn how to move to system browsers for Gmail authentications, read the Embedded vs System Web UI section in the [Using web browsers (MSAL.NET)](../develop/msal-net-web-browsers.md#embedded-vs-system-web-ui) documentation. All MSAL SDKs use the system web-view by default. [Learn more](../external-identities/google-federation.md#deprecation-of-web-view-sign-in-support).

### Google sign-in on embedded web-views expiring September 30, 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 

About two months ago we announced that the exception for Embedded WebViews for Gmail authentication will expire in the second half of 2021. 

Recently, Google has specified the date to be **September 30, 2021**. 

Rolling out globally beginning September 30, 2021, Azure AD B2B guests signing in with their Gmail accounts will now be prompted to enter a code in a separate browser window to finish signing in on Microsoft Teams mobile and desktop clients. This applies to invited guests and guests who signed up using Self-Service Sign-Up. 

Azure AD B2C customers who have set up embedded webview Gmail authentications in their custom/line of business apps or have existing Google integrations, will no longer can let their users sign in with Gmail accounts. To mitigate this, make sure to modify your apps to use the system browser for sign-in. For more information, read the Embedded vs System Web UI section in the [Using web browsers (MSAL.NET)](../develop/msal-net-web-browsers.md#embedded-vs-system-web-ui) documentation. All MSAL SDKs use the system web-view by default.

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management
 
An updated version of the PIM API for Azure Resource role and Azure AD role has been released.

### Unrequested but consented permissions will no longer be added to tokens if they would trigger Conditional Access

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Platform
 
Currently, applications using [dynamic permissions](../develop/v2-permissions-and-consent.md#requesting-individual-user-consent) are given all of the permissions they're consented to access. This includes applications that are unrequested and even if they trigger conditional access. For example, this can cause an app requesting only `user.read` that also has consent for `files.read`, to be forced to pass the Conditional Access assigned for the `files.read` permission. 

To reduce the number of unnecessary Conditional Access prompts, Azure AD is changing the way that unrequested scopes are provided to applications. Apps will only trigger conditional access for permission they explicitly request. For more information, read [What's new in authentication](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#conditional-access-will-only-trigger-for-explicitly-requested-scopes).

## October 2020

### Azure AD on-premises Hybrid Agents Impacted by Azure TLS Certificate Changes

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** N/A  
**Product capability:** Platform

Microsoft is updating Azure services to use TLS certificates from a different set of Root Certificate Authorities (CAs). This update is due to the current CA certificates not complying with one of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline requirements. This change will impact Azure AD hybrid agents installed on-premises that have hardened environments with a fixed list of root certificates and will need to be updated to trust the new certificate issuers.

This change will result in disruption of service if you don't take action immediately. These agents include [Application Proxy connectors](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AppProxy) for remote access to on-premises, [Passthrough Authentication](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AzureADConnect) agents that allow your users to sign in to applications using the same passwords, and [Cloud Provisioning Preview](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AzureADConnect) agents that perform AD to Azure AD sync. 

If you have an environment with firewall rules set to allow outbound calls to only specific Certificate Revocation List (CRL) download, you'll need to allow the following CRL and OCSP URLs. For full details on the change and the CRL and OCSP URLs to enable access to, see  [Azure TLS certificate changes](../../security/fundamentals/tls-certificate-changes.md).

Activity by the SCIM [provisioning service](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md) is logged in both the audit logs and provisioning logs. This includes activity such as the creation of a user in ServiceNow, group in GSuite, or import of a role from AWS. In the future, these events will only be published in the provisioning logs. This change is being implemented to avoid duplicate events across logs, and additional costs incurred by customers consuming the logs in log analytics. 

We'll provide an update when a date is completed. This deprecation isn't planned for the calendar year 2020. 

> [!NOTE]
> This does not impact any events in the audit logs outside of the synchronization events emitted by the provisioning service. Events such as the creation of an application, conditional access policy, a user in the directory, etc. will continue to be emitted in the audit logs. [Learn more](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md?context=azure%2factive-directory%2fapp-provisioning%2fcontext%2fapp-provisioning-context).

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Premium licenses, can also use the [Conditional Access – Sign-in Frequency policy](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-session-lifetime.md#user-sign-in-frequency) that provides more flexibility for reauthentication settings.

For the optimal user experience, we recommend using Conditional Access sign-in frequency to extend session lifetimes on trusted devices, locations, or low-risk sessions as an alternative to remember multifactor authentication (MFA) on a trusted device setting. To get started, review our [latest guidance on optimizing the reauthentication experience](../authentication/concepts-azure-multi-factor-authentication-prompts-session-lifetime.md).

### Cloud Provisioning Public Preview Refresh

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Cloud Provisioning 
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
Azure AD Connect Cloud Provisioning public preview refresh features two major enhancements developed from customer feedback: 

- Attribute Mapping Experience through Azure portal

    With this feature, IT Admins can map user, group, or contact attributes from AD to Azure AD using various mapping types present today. Attribute mapping is a feature used for standardizing the values of the attributes that flow from Active Directory to Azure Active Directory. One can determine whether to directly map the attribute value as it is from AD to Azure AD or use expressions to transform the attribute values when provisioning users. [Learn more](../cloud-sync/how-to-attribute-mapping.md)

- On-demand Provisioning or Test User experience

    Once you have set up your configuration, you might want to test to see if the user transformation is working as expected before applying it to all your users in scope. With on-demand provisioning, IT Admins can enter the Distinguished Name (DN) of an AD user and see if they're getting synced as expected. On-demand provisioning provides a great way to ensure that the attribute mappings you did previously work as expected. [Learn More](../cloud-sync/how-to-on-demand-provision.md)

### New delegation role in Azure AD entitlement management: Access package assignment manager

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** User Access Management  
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management
 
A new Access Package Assignment Manager role has been added in Azure AD entitlement management to provide granular permissions to manage assignments. You can now delegate tasks to a user in this role, who can delegate assignments management of an access package to a business owner. However, an Access Package Assignment Manager can't alter the access package policies or other properties that are set by the administrators. 

With this new role, you benefit from the least privileges needed to delegate management of assignments and maintain administrative control on all other access package configurations. To learn more, see [Entitlement management roles](../governance/entitlement-management-delegate.md#entitlement-management-roles).
 
---

### Changes to Privileged Identity Management's onboarding flow

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management
 
Previously, onboarding to Privileged Identity Management (PIM) required user consent and an onboarding flow in PIM's blade that included enrollment in Azure Active Directory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). With the recent integration of PIM experience into the Azure AD roles and administrators blade, we are removing this experience. Any tenant with valid P2 license will be auto-onboarded to PIM.

Onboarding to PIM does not have any direct adverse effect on your tenant. You can expect the following changes:
- Additional assignment options such as active vs. eligible with start and end time when you make an assignment in either PIM or Azure AD roles and administrators blade. 
- Additional scoping mechanisms, like Administrative Units and custom roles, introduced directly into the assignment experience. 
- If you're a global administrator or privileged role administrator, you may start getting a few additional emails like the PIM weekly digest. 
- You might also see ms-pim service principal in the audit log related to role assignment. This expected change shouldn't affect your regular workflow.

 For more information, see [Start using Privileged Identity Management](../privileged-identity-management/pim-getting-started.md).

### Azure AD Entitlement Management: The Select pane of access package resources now shows by default the resources currently in the selected catalog

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** User Access Management  
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management
 

In the access package creation flow, under the Resource roles tab, the Select pane behavior is changing. Currently, the default behavior is to show all resources that are owned by the user and resources added to the selected catalog. 

This experience will be changed to display only the resources currently added in the catalog by default, so that users can easily pick resources from the catalog. The update will help with discoverability of the resources to add to access packages, and reduce risk of inadvertently adding resources owned by the user that aren't part of the catalog. To learn more, see [Create a new access package in Azure AD entitlement management](../governance/entitlement-management-access-package-create.md#resource-roles).

## May 2020

### Retirement of properties in signIns, riskyUsers, and riskDetections APIs

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Identity Protection  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

Currently, enumerated types are used to represent the riskType property in both the riskDetections API and riskyUserHistoryItem (in preview). Enumerated types are also used for the riskEventTypes property in the signIns API. Going forward we'll represent these properties as strings. 

Customers should transition to the riskEventType property in the beta riskDetections and riskyUserHistoryItem API, and to riskEventTypes_v2 property in the beta signIns API by September 9th, 2020. At that date, we'll be retiring the current riskType and riskEventTypes properties. For more information, refer to [Changes to risk event properties and Identity Protection APIs on Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/changes-to-risk-event-properties-and-identity-protection-apis-on-microsoft-graph/).

--- 

### Deprecation of riskEventTypes property in signIns v1.0 API on Microsoft Graph

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

Enumerated types will switch to string types when representing risk event properties in Microsoft Graph September 2020. In addition to impacting the preview APIs, this change will also impact the in-production signIns API.

We have introduced a new riskEventsTypes_v2 (string) property to the signIns v1.0 API. We'll retire the current riskEventTypes (enum) property on June 11, 2022 in accordance with our Microsoft Graph deprecation policy. Customers should transition to the riskEventTypes_v2 property in the v1.0  signIns API by June 11, 2022. For more information, see [Deprecation of riskEventTypes property in signIns v1.0 API on Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/deprecation-of-riskeventtypes-property-in-signins-v1-0-api-on-microsoft-graph//).

### Upcoming changes to multifactor authentication (MFA) email notifications

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 

We're making the following changes to the email notifications for cloud multifactor authentication (MFA):

E-mail notifications will be sent from the following address: azure-noreply@microsoft.com and msonlineservicesteam@microsoftonline.com. We're updating the content of fraud alert emails to better indicate the required steps to unblock uses.

### New self-service sign up for users in federated domains who can't access Microsoft Teams because they aren't synced to Azure Active Directory.

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 

Currently, users who are in domains federated in Azure AD, but who aren't synced into the tenant, can't access Teams. Starting at the end of June, this new capability will enable them to do so by extending the existing email verified sign-up feature. This will allow users who can sign in to a federated IdP, but who don't yet have a user object in Azure ID, to have a user object created automatically and be authenticated for Teams. Their user object will be marked as "self-service sign-up." This is an extension of the existing capability to do email verified self-sign up that users in managed domains can do and can be controlled using the same flag. This change will complete rolling out during the following two months. Watch for documentation updates [here](../enterprise-users/directory-self-service-signup.md).
 
---

### Upcoming fix: The OIDC discovery document for the Azure Government cloud is being updated to reference the correct Graph endpoints.

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Sovereign Clouds  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
Starting in June, the OIDC discovery document [Microsoft identity platform and OpenID Connect protocol](../develop/v2-protocols-oidc.md) on the [Azure Government cloud](../develop/authentication-national-cloud.md) endpoint (login.microsoftonline.us), will begin to return the correct [National cloud graph](/graph/deployments) endpoint (https://graph.microsoft.us or https://dod-graph.microsoft.us), based on the tenant provided.  It currently provides the incorrect Graph endpoint (graph.microsoft.com) "msgraph_host" field.  

This bug fix will be rolled out gradually over approximately 2 months.  

---

### Azure Government users will no longer be able to sign in on login.microsoftonline.com

**Type:** Plan for Change  
**Service category:** Sovereign Clouds  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
On 1 June 2018, the official Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Authority for Azure Government changed from https://login-us.microsoftonline.com to https://login.microsoftonline.us. If you own an application within an Azure Government tenant, you must update your application to sign users in on the.us endpoint.

Starting May 5th, Azure AD will begin enforcing the endpoint change, blocking Azure Government users from signing into apps hosted in Azure Government tenants using the public endpoint (microsoftonline.com). Impacted apps will begin seeing an error AADSTS900439 - USGClientNotSupportedOnPublicEndpoint. 

There will be a gradual rollout of this change with enforcement expected to be complete across all apps June 2020. For more details, please see the [Azure Government blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azuregov/azure-government-aad-authority-endpoint-update/).

### SAML Single Logout request now sends NameID in the correct format

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
When a user clicks on sign-out (for example, in the MyApps portal), Azure AD sends a SAML Single Logout message to each app that is active in the user session and has a Logout URL configured. These messages contain a NameID in a persistent format.

If the original SAML sign-in token used a different format for NameID (for example, email/UPN), then the SAML app cannot correlate the NameID in the logout message to an existing session (as the NameIDs used in both messages are different), which caused the logout message to be discarded by the SAML app and the user to stay logged in. This fix makes the sign-out message consistent with the NameID configured for the application.

---

### Hybrid Identity Administrator role is now available with Cloud Provisioning

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Cloud Provisioning  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
IT Admins can start using the new "Hybrid Admin" role as the least privileged role for setting up Azure AD Connect Cloud Provisioning. With this new role, you no longer have to use the Global Administrator role to set up and configure Cloud Provisioning. [Learn more](../roles/delegate-by-task.md#connect).

### The new App registrations experience for Azure AD B2C is now generally available

**Type:** Changed Feature   
**Service category:** B2C - Consumer Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
The new App registrations experience for Azure AD B2C is now generally available. 

Previously, you had to manage your B2C consumer-facing applications separately from the rest of your apps using the legacy 'Applications' experience. That meant different app creation experiences across different places in Azure.

The new experience shows all B2C app registrations and Azure AD app registrations in one place and provides a consistent way to manage them. Whether you need to manage a customer-facing app or an app that has access to Microsoft Graph to programmatically manage Azure AD B2C resources, you only need to learn one way to do things.

You can reach the new experience by navigating the Azure AD B2C service and selecting the App registrations blade. The experience is also accessible from the Azure Active Directory service.

The Azure AD B2C App registrations experience is based on the general [App Registration experience](https://developer.microsoft.com/identity/blogs/new-app-registrations-experience-is-now-generally-available/) for Azure AD tenants but is tailored for Azure AD B2C. The legacy "Applications" experience will be deprecated in the future.

For more information, visit [The New app registration experience for Azure AD B2C](../../active-directory-b2c/app-registrations-training-guide.md).

### Workday inbound user provisioning and writeback apps now support the latest versions of Workday Web Services API

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** App Provisioning

**Product capability:** 

Based on customer feedback, we've now updated the Workday inbound user provisioning and writeback apps in the enterprise app gallery to support the latest versions of the Workday Web Services (WWS) API. With this change, customers can specify the WWS API version that they would like to use in the connection string. This gives customers the ability to retrieve more HR attributes available in the releases of Workday. The Workday Writeback app now uses the recommended Change_Work_Contact_Info Workday web service to overcome the limitations of Maintain_Contact_Info.

If no version is specified in the connection string, by default, the Workday inbound provisioning apps will continue to use WWS v21.1  To switch to the latest Workday APIs for inbound user provisioning, customers need to update the connection string as documented [in the tutorial](../saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial.md#which-workday-apis-does-the-solution-use-to-query-and-update-workday-worker-profiles) and also update the XPATHs used for Workday attributes as documented in the [Workday attribute reference guide](../app-provisioning/workday-attribute-reference.md#xpath-values-for-workday-web-services-wws-api-v30). 

To use the new API for writeback, there are no changes required in the Workday Writeback provisioning app. On the Workday side, ensure that the Workday Integration System User (ISU) account has permissions to invoke the Change_Work_Contact business process as documented in the tutorial section, [Configure business process security policy permissions](../saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial.md#configuring-business-process-security-policy-permissions). 

We have updated our [tutorial guide](../saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial.md) to reflect the new API version support.

### Users with default access role are now in scope for provisioning

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** App Provisioning

**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management

Historically, users with the default access role have been out of scope for provisioning. We've heard feedback that customers want users with this role to be in scope for provisioning. As of April 16, 2020, all new provisioning configurations allow users with the default access role to be provisioned. Gradually we'll change the behavior for existing provisioning configurations to support provisioning users with this role. [Learn more.](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-config-problem-no-users-provisioned.md)

### Dynamic Group rule validation is now available for Public Preview

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** Group Management

**Product capability:** Collaboration

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) now provides the means to validate dynamic group rules. On the **Validate rules** tab, you can validate your dynamic rule against sample group members to confirm the rule is working as expected. When creating or updating dynamic group rules, administrators want to know whether a user or a device will be a member of the group. This helps evaluate whether a user or device meets the rule criteria and aids in troubleshooting when membership is not expected.

For more information, see [Validate a dynamic group membership rule (preview)](../enterprise-users/groups-dynamic-rule-validation.md).

### Identity Secure Score - Security Defaults and multifactor authentication (MFA) improvement action updates

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** N/A

**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

**Supporting security defaults for Azure AD improvement actions:** Microsoft Secure Score will be updating improvement actions to support [security defaults in Azure AD](./concept-fundamentals-security-defaults.md), which make it easier to help protect your organization with pre-configured security settings for common attacks. This will affect the following improvement actions:

- Ensure all users can complete multifactor authentication for secure access
- Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative roles
- Enable policy to block legacy authentication
 
**Multifactor authentication (MFA) improvement action updates:** To reflect the need for businesses to ensure the upmost security while applying policies that work with their business, Microsoft Secure Score has removed three improvement actions centered around multifactor authentication and added two.

Removed improvement actions:

- Register all users for multifactor authentication
- Require multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users
- Require multifactor authentication (MFA) for Azure AD privileged roles

Added improvement actions:

- Ensure all users can complete multifactor authentication for secure access
- Require multifactor authentication (MFA) for administrative roles

These new improvement actions require registering your users or admins for multifactor authentication (MFA) across your directory and establishing the right set of policies that fit your organizational needs. The main goal is to have flexibility while ensuring all your users and admins can authenticate with multiple factors or risk-based identity verification prompts. That can take the form of having multiple policies that apply scoped decisions, or setting security defaults (as of March 16th) that let Microsoft decide when to challenge users for multifactor authentication (MFA). [Read more about what's new in Microsoft Secure Score](/microsoft-365/security/mtp/microsoft-secure-score#whats-new).

### Disaster recovery: Download and store your provisioning configuration

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** App Provisioning  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
The Azure AD provisioning service provides a rich set of configuration capabilities. Customers need to be able to save their configuration so that they can refer to it later or roll back to a known good version. We've added the ability to download your provisioning configuration as a JSON file and upload it when you need it. [Learn more](../app-provisioning/export-import-provisioning-configuration.md).

### SSPR (self-service password reset) now requires two gates for admins in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure China 21Vianet) 

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Self-Service Password Reset  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
Previously in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure China 21Vianet), admins using self-service password reset (SSPR) to reset their own passwords needed only one "gate" (challenge) to prove their identity. In public and other national clouds, admins generally must use two gates to prove their identity when using SSPR. But because we didn't support SMS or phone calls in Azure China 21Vianet, we allowed one-gate password reset by admins.

We're creating SSPR feature parity between Azure China 21Vianet and the public cloud. Going forward, admins must use two gates when using SSPR. SMS, phone calls, and Authenticator app notifications and codes will be supported. [Learn more](../authentication/concept-sspr-policy.md#administrator-reset-policy-differences).

### Password length is limited to 256 characters

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
To ensure the reliability of the Azure AD service, user passwords are now limited in length to 256 characters. Users with passwords longer than this will be asked to change their password on subsequent login, either by contacting their admin or by using the self-service password reset feature.

This change was enabled on March 13th, 2020, at 10AM PST (18:00 UTC), and the error is AADSTS 50052, InvalidPasswordExceedsMaxLength. See the [breaking change notice](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#user-passwords-will-be-restricted-to-256-characters) for more details.

### Azure AD sign-in logs are now available for all free tenants through the Azure portal

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting
 
Starting now, customers who have free tenants can access the [Azure AD sign-in logs from the Azure portal](../reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins.md) for up to 7 days. Previously, sign-in logs were available only for customers with Azure Active Directory Premium licenses. With this change, all tenants can access these logs through the portal.

> [!NOTE]
> Customers still need a premium license (Azure Active Directory Premium P1 or P2) to access the sign-in logs through Microsoft Graph API and Azure Monitor.

### Deprecation of Directory-wide groups option from Groups General Settings on Azure portal

**Type:** Deprecated  
**Service category:** Group Management  
**Product capability:** Collaboration

To provide a more flexible way for customers to create directory-wide groups that best meet their needs, we've replaced the **Directory-wide Groups** option from the **Groups** > **General** settings in the Azure portal with a link to [dynamic group documentation](../enterprise-users/groups-dynamic-membership.md). We've improved our documentation to include more instructions so administrators can create all-user groups that include or exclude guest users.

---

## February 2020

### Upcoming changes to custom controls

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
We're planning to replace the current custom controls preview with an approach that allows partner-provided authentication capabilities to work seamlessly with the Azure Active Directory administrator and end user experiences. Today, partner multifactor authentication (MFA) solutions face the following limitations: they work only after a password has been entered; they don't serve as multifactor authentication (MFA) for step-up authentication in other key scenarios; and they don't integrate with end user or administrative credential management functions. The new implementation will allow partner-provided authentication factors to work alongside built-in factors for key scenarios, including registration, usage, multifactor authentication (MFA) claims, step up authentication, reporting, and logging. 

Custom controls will continue to be supported in preview alongside the new design until it reaches general availability. At that point, we'll give customers time to migrate to the new design. Because of the limitations of the current approach, we won't onboard new providers until the new design is available. We're working closely with customers and providers and will communicate the timeline as we get closer. [Learn more](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/upcoming-changes-to-custom-controls/ba-p/1144696#).

### Identity Secure Score - multifactor authentication (MFA) improvement action updates

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
To reflect the need for businesses to ensure the upmost security while applying policies that work with their business, Microsoft Secure Score is removing three improvement actions centered around multifactor authentication (MFA), and adding two.

The following improvement actions will be removed:

- Register all users for  multifactor authentication (MFA)
- Require multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users
- Require multifactor authentication (MFA) for Azure AD privileged roles

The following improvement actions will be added:

- Ensure all users can complete multifactor authentication (MFA) for secure access
- Require multifactor authentication (MFA) for administrative roles

These new improvement actions will require registering your users or admins for multifactor authentication (MFA) across your directory and establishing the right set of policies that fit your organizational needs. The main goal is to have flexibility while ensuring all your users and admins can authenticate with multiple factors or risk-based identity verification prompts. This can take the form of setting security defaults that let Microsoft decide when to challenge users for multifactor authentication (MFA), or having multiple policies that apply scoped decisions. As part of these improvement action updates, Baseline protection policies will no longer be included in scoring calculations. [Read more about what's coming in Microsoft Secure Score](/microsoft-365/security/mtp/microsoft-secure-score-whats-coming).

### Azure AD Domain Services SKU selection

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Domain Services  
**Product capability:** Azure AD Domain Services
 
We've heard feedback that Azure AD Domain Services customers want more flexibility in selecting performance levels for their instances. Starting on February 1, 2020, we switched from a dynamic model (where Azure AD determines the performance and pricing tier based on object count) to a self-selection model. Now customers can choose a performance tier that matches their environment. This change also allows us to enable new scenarios like Resource Forests, and Premium features like daily backups. The object count is now unlimited for all SKUs, but we'll continue to offer object count suggestions for each tier.

**No immediate customer action is required.** For existing customers, the dynamic tier that was in use on February 1, 2020, determines the new default tier. There is no pricing or performance impact as the result of this change. Going forward, Azure AD DS customers will need to evaluate performance requirements as their directory size and workload characteristics change. Switching between service tiers will continue to be a no-downtime operation, and we'll no longer automatically move customers to new tiers based on the growth of their directory. Furthermore, there will be no price increases, and new pricing will align with our current billing model. For more information, see the [Azure AD DS SKUs documentation](../../active-directory-domain-services/administration-concepts.md#azure-ad-ds-skus) and the [Azure AD Domain Services pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory-ds/).

### Replacement of baseline policies with security defaults

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Identity Security and Protection

As part of a secure-by-default model for authentication, we're removing the existing baseline protection policies from all tenants. This removal is targeted for completion at the end of February. The replacement for these baseline protection policies is security defaults. If you've been using baseline protection policies, you must plan to move to the new security defaults policy or to Conditional Access. If you haven't used these policies, there is no action for you to take.

For more information about the new security defaults, see [What are security defaults?](./concept-fundamentals-security-defaults.md) For more information about Conditional Access policies, see [Common Conditional Access policies](../conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common.md).

## November 2019

### Support for the SameSite attribute and Chrome 80

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

As part of a secure-by-default model for cookies, the Chrome 80 browser is changing how it treats cookies without the `SameSite` attribute. Any cookie that doesn't specify the `SameSite` attribute will be treated as though it was set to `SameSite=Lax`, which will result in Chrome blocking certain cross-domain cookie sharing scenarios that your app may depend on. To maintain the older Chrome behavior, you can use the `SameSite=None` attribute and add an additional `Secure` attribute, so cross-site cookies can only be accessed over HTTPS connections. Chrome is scheduled to complete this change by February 4, 2020.

We recommend all our developers test their apps using this guidance:

- Set the default value for the **Use Secure Cookie** setting to **Yes**.

- Set the default value for the **SameSite** attribute to **None**.

- Add an additional `SameSite` attribute of **Secure**.

For more information, see [Upcoming SameSite Cookie Changes in ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/upcoming-samesite-cookie-changes-in-asp-net-and-asp-net-core/) and [Potential disruption to customer websites and Microsoft products and services in Chrome version 79 and later](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4522904/potential-disruption-to-microsoft-services-in-chrome-beta-version-79).

### Application Proxy support for the SameSite Attribute and Chrome 80

**Type:** Plan for change
**Service category:** App Proxy
**Product capability:** Access Control

A couple of weeks prior to the Chrome 80 browser release, we plan to update how Application Proxy cookies treat the **SameSite** attribute. With the release of Chrome 80, any cookie that doesn't specify the **SameSite** attribute will be treated as though it was set to `SameSite=Lax`.

To help avoid potentially negative impacts due to this change, we're updating Application Proxy access and session cookies by:

- Setting the default value for the **Use Secure Cookie** setting to **Yes**.

- Setting the default value for the **SameSite** attribute to **None**.

    >[!NOTE]
    > Application Proxy access cookies have always been transmitted exclusively over secure channels. These changes only apply to session cookies.

For more information about the Application Proxy cookie settings, see [Cookie settings for accessing on-premises applications in Azure Active Directory](../app-proxy/application-proxy-configure-cookie-settings.md).

### New Azure AD Global Reader role

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** Azure AD roles
**Product capability:** Access Control

Starting on September 24, 2019, we're going to start rolling out a new Azure Active Directory (AD) role called Global Reader. This rollout will start with production and Global cloud customers (GCC), finishing up worldwide in October.

The Global Reader role is the read-only counterpart to Global Administrator. Users in this role can read settings and administrative information across Microsoft 365 services, but can't take management actions. We've created the Global Reader role to help reduce the number of Global Administrators in your organization. Because Global Administrator accounts are powerful and vulnerable to attack, we recommend that you have fewer than five Global Administrators. We recommend using the Global Reader role for planning, audits, or investigations. We also recommend using the Global Reader role in combination with other limited administrator roles, like Exchange Administrator, to help get work done without requiring the Global Administrator role.

### ADAL.NET ignores the MSAL.NET shared cache for on-behalf-of scenarios

**Type:** Fixed
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Starting with Azure AD authentication library (ADAL.NET) version 5.0.0-preview, app developers must [serialize one cache per account for web apps and web APIs](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Token-cache-serialization#custom-token-cache-serialization-in-web-applications--web-api). Otherwise, some scenarios using the [on-behalf-of flow](../develop/scenario-web-api-call-api-app-configuration.md?tabs=java) for Java, along with some specific use cases of `UserAssertion`, may result in an elevation of privilege. To avoid this vulnerability, ADAL.NET now ignores the Microsoft Authentication Library for dotnet (MSAL.NET) shared cache for on-behalf-of scenarios.

For more information about this issue, see [Azure Active Directory Authentication Library Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1258).

## July 2019

### Plan for change: Application Proxy service update to support only TLS 1.2

**Type:** Plan for change
**Service category:** App Proxy
**Product capability:** Access Control

To help provide you with our strongest encryption, we're going to begin limiting Application Proxy service access to only TLS 1.2 protocols. This limitation will initially be rolled out to customers who are already using TLS 1.2 protocols, so you won't see the impact. Complete deprecation of the TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols will be complete on August 31, 2019. Customers still using TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 will receive advanced notice to prepare for this change.

To maintain the connection to the Application Proxy service throughout this change, we recommend that you make sure your client-server and browser-server combinations are updated to use TLS 1.2. We also recommend that you make sure to include any client systems used by your employees to access apps published through the Application Proxy service.

For more information, see [Add an on-premises application for remote access through Application Proxy in Azure Active Directory](../app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application.md).

### App-only tokens now require the client app to exist in the resource tenant

**Type:** Fixed
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)
**Product capability:** User Authentication

On July 26, 2019, we changed how we provide app-only tokens through the [client credentials grant](../develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md). Previously, apps could get tokens to call other apps, regardless of whether the client app was in the tenant. We've updated this behavior so single-tenant resources, sometimes called Web APIs, can only be called by client apps that exist in the resource tenant.

If your app isn't located in the resource tenant, you'll get an error message that says, `The service principal named <app_name> was not found in the tenant named <tenant_name>. This can happen if the application has not been installed by the administrator of the tenant.` To fix this problem, you must create the client app service principal in the tenant, using either the [admin consent endpoint](../develop/v2-permissions-and-consent.md#using-the-admin-consent-endpoint) or [through PowerShell](../develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell.md), which ensures your tenant has given the app permission to operate within the tenant.

For more information, see [What's new for authentication?](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#app-only-tokens-for-single-tenant-applications-are-only-issued-if-the-client-app-exists-in-the-resource-tenant).

> [!NOTE]
> Existing consent between the client and the API continues to not be required. Apps should still be doing their own authorization checks.

### Azure AD now supports static query parameters in reply (redirect) URIs

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Azure AD apps can now register and use reply (redirect) URIs with static query parameters (for example, `https://contoso.com/oauth2?idp=microsoft`) for OAuth 2.0 requests. The static query parameter is subject to string matching for reply URIs, just like any other part of the reply URI. If there's no registered string that matches the URL-decoded redirect-uri, the request is rejected. If the reply URI is found, the entire string is used to redirect the user, including the static query parameter.

Dynamic reply URIs are still forbidden because they represent a security risk and can't be used to retain state information across an authentication request. For this purpose, use the `state` parameter.

Currently, the app registration screens of the Azure portal still block query parameters. However, you can manually edit the app manifest to add and test query parameters in your app. For more information, see [What's new for authentication?](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#redirect-uris-can-now-contain-query-string-parameters).

These requests, whether they're successful or not, all contribute to a poor user experience and heightened workloads for the IDP, increasing latency for all users and reducing the availability of the IDP.

This update sends an `invalid_grant` error: `AADSTS50196: The server terminated an operation because it encountered a loop while processing a request` to client apps that issue duplicate requests multiple times over a short period of time, beyond the scope of normal operation. Client apps that encounter this issue should show an interactive prompt, requiring the user to sign in again. For more information about this change and about how to fix your app if it encounters this error, see [What's new for authentication?](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#looping-clients-will-be-interrupted).

### Enhanced combined multi-factor authentication (MFA)/SSPR registration

**Type:** Changed feature
**Service category:** Self Service Password Reset
**Product capability:** User Authentication

In response to customer feedback, we've enhanced the combined multifactor authentication (MFA)/SSPR registration preview experience, helping your users to more quickly register their security info for both multifactor authentication (MFA) and SSPR.

**To turn on the enhanced experience for your users' today, follow these steps:**

1. As a global administrator or user administrator, sign in to the Azure portal and go to **Azure Active Directory > User settings > Manage settings for access panel preview features**.

2. In the **Users who can use the preview features for registering and managing security info – refresh** option, choose to turn on the features for a **Selected group of users** or for **All users**.

Over the next few weeks, we'll be removing the ability to turn on the old combined multifactor authentication (MFA)/SSPR registration preview experience for tenants that don't already have it turned on.

**To see if the control will be removed for your tenant, follow these steps:**

1. As a global administrator or user administrator, sign in to the Azure portal and go to **Azure Active Directory > User settings > Manage settings for access panel preview features**.

2. If the **Users who can use the preview features for registering and managing security info** option is set to **None**, the option will be removed from your tenant.

Regardless of whether you previously turned on the old combined multifactor authentication (MFA)/SSPR registration preview experience for users or not, the old experience will be turned off at a future date. Because of that, we strongly suggest that you move to the new, enhanced experience as soon as possible.

For more information about the enhanced registration experience, see the [Cool enhancements to the Azure AD combined MFA and password reset registration experience](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Active-Directory-Identity/Cool-enhancements-to-the-Azure-AD-combined-MFA-and-password/ba-p/354271).

## January 2019

### Active Directory B2B collaboration using one-time passcode authentication (Public preview)

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** B2B
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C

We've introduced one-time passcode authentication (OTP) for B2B guest users who can't be authenticated through other means like Azure AD, a Microsoft account (MSA), or Google federation. This new authentication method means that guest users don't have to create a new Microsoft account. Instead, while redeeming an invitation or accessing a shared resource, a guest user can request a temporary code to be sent to an email address. Using this temporary code, the guest user can continue to sign in.

For more information, see [Email one-time passcode authentication (preview)](../external-identities/one-time-passcode.md) and the blog, [Azure AD makes sharing and collaboration seamless for any user with any account](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Active-Directory-Identity/Azure-AD-makes-sharing-and-collaboration-seamless-for-any-user/ba-p/325949).

### New Azure AD Application Proxy cookie settings

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** App Proxy
**Product capability:** Access Control

We've introduced three new cookie settings, available for your apps that are published through Application Proxy:

- **Use HTTP-Only cookie.** Sets the **HTTPOnly** flag on your Application Proxy access and session cookies. Turning on this setting provides additional security benefits, such as helping to prevent copying or modifying of cookies through client-side scripting. We recommend you turn on this flag (choose **Yes**) for the added benefits.

- **Use secure cookie.** Sets the **Secure** flag on your Application Proxy access and session cookies. Turning on this setting provides additional security benefits, by making sure cookies are only transmitted over TLS secure channels, such as HTTPS. We recommend you turn on this flag (choose **Yes**) for the added benefits.

- **Use persistent cookie.** Prevents access cookies from expiring when the web browser is closed. These cookies last for the lifetime of the access token. However, the cookies are reset if the expiration time is reached or if the user manually deletes the cookie. We recommend you keep the default setting **No**, only turning on the setting for older apps that don't share cookies between processes.

For more information about the new cookies, see [Cookie settings for accessing on-premises applications in Azure Active Directory](../app-proxy/application-proxy-configure-cookie-settings.md).

## November/December 2018

### Users removed from synchronization scope no longer switch to cloud-only accounts

**Type:** Fixed
**Service category:** User Management
**Product capability:** Directory

>[!Important]
>We've heard and understand your frustration because of this fix. Therefore, we've reverted this change until such time that we can make the fix easier for you to implement in your organization.

We've fixed a bug in which the DirSyncEnabled flag of a user would be erroneously switched to **False** when the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) object was excluded from synchronization scope and then moved to the Recycle Bin in Azure AD on the following sync cycle. As a result of this fix, if the user is excluded from sync scope and afterwards restored from Azure AD Recycle Bin, the user account remains as synchronized from on-premises AD, as expected, and cannot be managed in the cloud since its source of authority (SoA) remains as on-premises AD.

Prior to this fix, there was an issue when the DirSyncEnabled flag was switched to False. It gave the wrong impression that these accounts were converted to cloud-only objects and that the accounts could be managed in the cloud. However, the accounts still retained their SoA as on-premises and all synchronized properties (shadow attributes) coming from on-premises AD. This condition caused multiple issues in Azure AD and other cloud workloads (like Exchange Online) that expected to treat these accounts as synchronized from AD but were now behaving like cloud-only accounts.

At this time, the only way to truly convert a synchronized-from-AD account to cloud-only account is by disabling DirSync at the tenant level, which triggers a backend operation to transfer the SoA. This type of SoA change requires (but is not limited to) cleaning all the on-premises related attributes (such as LastDirSyncTime and shadow attributes) and sending a signal to other cloud workloads to have its respective object converted to a cloud-only account too.

This fix consequently prevents direct updates on the ImmutableID attribute of a user synchronized from AD, which in some scenarios in the past were required. By design, the ImmutableID of an object in Azure AD, as the name implies, is meant to be immutable. New features implemented in Azure AD Connect Health and Azure AD Connect Synchronization client are available to address such scenarios:

- **Large-scale ImmutableID update for many users in a staged approach**

  For example, you need to do a lengthy AD DS inter-forest migration. Solution: Use Azure AD Connect to **Configure Source Anchor** and, as the user migrates, copy the existing ImmutableID values from Azure AD into the local AD DS user's ms-DS-Consistency-Guid attribute of the new forest. For more information, see [Using ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid as sourceAnchor](../hybrid/plan-connect-design-concepts.md#using-ms-ds-consistencyguid-as-sourceanchor).

- **Large-scale ImmutableID updates for many users in one shot**

  For example, while implementing Azure AD Connect you make a mistake, and now you need to change the SourceAnchor attribute. Solution: Disable DirSync at the tenant level and clear all the invalid ImmutableID values. For more information, see [Turn off directory synchronization for Office 365](/office365/enterprise/turn-off-directory-synchronization).

- **Rematch on-premises user with an existing user in Azure AD**
  For example, a user that has been re-created in AD DS generates a duplicate in Azure AD account instead of rematching it with an existing Azure AD account (orphaned object). Solution: Use Azure AD Connect Health in the Azure portal to remap the Source Anchor/ImmutableID. For more information, see [Orphaned object scenario](../hybrid/how-to-connect-health-diagnose-sync-errors.md#orphaned-object-scenario).

### Identity Protection improvements to the supervised machine learning model and the risk score engine

**Type:** Changed feature
**Service category:** Identity Protection
**Product capability:** Risk Scores

Improvements to the Identity Protection-related user and sign-in risk assessment engine can help to improve user risk accuracy and coverage. Administrators may notice that user risk level is no longer directly linked to the risk level of specific detections, and that there's an increase in the number and level of risky sign-in events.

Risk detections are now evaluated by the supervised machine learning model, which calculates user risk by using additional features of the user's sign-ins and a pattern of detections. Based on this model, the administrator might find users with high risk scores, even if detections associated with that user are of low or medium risk.

### Change notice: Authorization codes will no longer be available for reuse

**Type:** Plan for change
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Starting on November 15, 2018, Azure AD will stop accepting previously used authentication codes for apps. This security change helps to bring Azure AD in line with the OAuth specification and will be enforced on both the v1 and v2 endpoints.

If your app reuses authorization codes to get tokens for multiple resources, we recommend that you use the code to get a refresh token, and then use that refresh token to acquire additional tokens for other resources. Authorization codes can only be used once, but refresh tokens can be used multiple times across multiple resources. An app that attempts to reuse an authentication code during the OAuth code flow will get an invalid_grant error.

For this and other protocols-related changes, see [the full list of what's new for authentication](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md).

## August 2018

### Changes to Azure Active Directory IP address ranges

**Type:** Plan for change
**Service category:** Other
**Product capability:** Platform

We're introducing larger IP ranges to Azure AD, which means if you've configured Azure AD IP address ranges for your firewalls, routers, or Network Security Groups, you'll need to update them. We're making this update so you won't have to change your firewall, router, or Network Security Groups IP range configurations again when Azure AD adds new endpoints.

Network traffic is moving to these new ranges over the next two months. To continue with uninterrupted service, you must add these updated values to your IP Addresses before September 10, 2018:

- 20.190.128.0/18

- 40.126.0.0/18

We strongly recommend not removing the old IP Address ranges until all of your network traffic has moved to the new ranges. For updates about the move and to learn when you can remove the old ranges, see [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://support.office.com/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2).

### Converged security info management for self-service password (SSPR) and multifactor authentication (MFA)

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** SSPR
**Product capability:** User Authentication

This new feature helps people manage their security info (such as, phone number, mobile app, and so on) for SSPR and multifactor authentication (MFA) in a single location and experience; as compared to previously, where it was done in two different locations.

This converged experience also works for people using either SSPR or multifactor authentication (MFA). Additionally, if your organization doesn't enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) or SSPR registration, people can still register any multifactor authentication (MFA) or SSPR security info methods allowed by your organization from the My Apps portal.

This is an opt-in public preview. Administrators can turn on the new experience (if desired) for a selected group or for all users in a tenant. For more information about the converged experience, see the [Converged experience blog](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2018/08/06/mfa-and-sspr-updates-now-in-public-preview/)

### New HTTP-Only cookies setting in Azure AD Application proxy apps

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** App Proxy
**Product capability:** Access Control

There's a new setting called, **HTTP-Only Cookies** in your Application Proxy apps. This setting helps provide extra security by including the HTTPOnly flag in the HTTP response header for both Application Proxy access and session cookies, stopping access to the cookie from a client-side script and further preventing actions like copying or modifying the cookie. Although this flag hasn't been used previously, your cookies have always been encrypted and transmitted using a TLS connection to help protect against improper modifications.

This setting isn't compatible with apps using ActiveX controls, such as Remote Desktop. If you're in this situation, we recommend that you turn off this setting.

For more information about the HTTP-Only Cookies setting, see [Publish applications using Azure AD Application Proxy](../app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application.md).

This new experience also applies to users who have either SSPR or multifactor authentication (MFA).

If an organization isn't enforcing multifactor authentication (MFA) or SSPR registration, users can register their security info through the **My Apps** portal. From there, users can register any methods enabled for multifactor authentication (MFA) or SSPR.

This is an opt-in public preview. Admins can turn on the new experience (if desired) for a selected group of users or all users in a tenant.

### Use the Microsoft Authenticator app to verify your identity when you reset your password

**Type:** Changed feature
**Service category:** SSPR
**Product capability:** User Authentication

This feature lets non-admins verify their identity while resetting a password using a notification or code from Microsoft Authenticator (or any other authenticator app). After admins turn on this self-service password reset method, users who have registered a mobile app through aka.ms/mfasetup or aka.ms/setupsecurityinfo can use their mobile app as a verification method while resetting their password.

Mobile app notification can only be turned on as part of a policy that requires two methods to reset your password.

## June 2018

### Change notice: Security fix to the delegated authorization flow for apps using Azure AD Activity Logs API

**Type:** Plan for change
**Service category:** Reporting
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting

Due to our stronger security enforcement, we've had to make a change to the permissions for apps that use a delegated authorization flow to access [Azure AD Activity Logs APIs](../reports-monitoring/concept-reporting-api.md). This change will occur by **June 26, 2018**.

If any of your apps use Azure AD Activity Log APIs, follow these steps to ensure the app doesn't break after the change happens.

**To update your app permissions**

1. Sign in to the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, and then select **App Registrations**.
2. Select your app that uses the Azure AD Activity Logs API, select **Settings**, select **Required permissions**, and then select the **Windows Azure Active Directory** API.
3. In the **Delegated permissions** area of the **Enable access** blade, select the box next to **Read directory** data, and then select **Save**.
4. Select **Grant permissions**, and then select **Yes**.

    >[!Note]
    >You must be a Global administrator to grant permissions to the app.

For more information, see the [Grant permissions](../reports-monitoring/howto-configure-prerequisites-for-reporting-api.md#grant-permissions) area of the Prerequisites to access the Azure AD reporting API article.

### Configure TLS settings to connect to Azure AD services for PCI DSS compliance

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** N/A
**Product capability:** Platform

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between two communicating applications and is the most widely deployed security protocol used today.

The [PCI Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) has determined that early versions of TLS and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) must be disabled in favor of enabling new and more secure app protocols, with compliance starting on **June 30, 2018**. This change means that if you connect to Azure AD services and require PCI DSS-compliance, you must disable TLS 1.0. Multiple versions of TLS are available, but TLS 1.2 is the latest version available for Azure Active Directory Services. We highly recommend moving directly to TLS 1.2 for both client/server and browser/server combinations.

Out-of-date browsers might not support newer TLS versions, such as TLS 1.2. To see which versions of TLS are supported by your browser, go to the [Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/) site and select **Test your browser**. We recommend you upgrade to the latest version of your web browser and preferably enable only TLS 1.2.

**To enable TLS 1.2, by browser**

- **Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer (both are set using Internet Explorer)**

    1. Open Internet Explorer, select **Tools** > **Internet Options** > **Advanced**.
    2. In the **Security** area, select **use TLS 1.2**, and then select **OK**.
    3. Close all browser windows and restart Internet Explorer.

- **Google Chrome**

    1. Open Google Chrome, type *chrome://settings/* into the address bar, and press **Enter**.
    2. Expand the **Advanced** options, go to the **System** area, and select **Open proxy settings**.
    3. In the **Internet Properties** box, select the **Advanced** tab, go to the **Security** area, select **use TLS 1.2**, and then select **OK**.
    4. Close all browser windows and restart Google Chrome.

- **Mozilla Firefox**

    1. Open Firefox, type *about:config* into the address bar, and then press **Enter**.
    2. Search for the term, *TLS*, and then select the **security.tls.version.max** entry.
    3. Set the value to **3** to force the browser to use up to version TLS 1.2, and then select **OK**.

        >[!NOTE]
        >Firefox version 60.0 supports TLS 1.3, so you can also set the security.tls.version.max value to **4**.

    4. Close all browser windows and restart Mozilla Firefox.

## May 2018

### ExpressRoute support changes

**Type:** Plan for change
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)
**Product capability:** Platform

Software as a Service offering, like Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) are designed to work best by going directly through the Internet, without requiring ExpressRoute or any other private VPN tunnels. Because of this, on **August 1, 2018**, we'll stop supporting ExpressRoute for Azure AD services using Azure public peering and Azure communities in Microsoft peering. Any services impacted by this change might notice Azure AD traffic gradually shifting from ExpressRoute to the Internet.

While we're changing our support, we also know there are still situations where you might need to use a dedicated set of circuits for your authentication traffic. Because of this, Azure AD will continue to support per-tenant IP range restrictions using ExpressRoute and services already on Microsoft peering with the "Other Office 365 Online services" community. If your services are impacted, but you require ExpressRoute, you must do the following:

- **If you're on Azure public peering.** Move to Microsoft peering and sign up for the **Other Office 365 Online services (12076:5100)** community. For more info about how to move from Azure public peering to Microsoft peering, see the [Move a public peering to Microsoft peering](../../expressroute/how-to-move-peering.md) article.

- **If you're on Microsoft peering.** Sign up for the **Other Office 365 Online service (12076:5100)** community. For more info about routing requirements, see the [Support for BGP communities section](../../expressroute/expressroute-routing.md#bgp) of the ExpressRoute routing requirements article.

If you must continue to use dedicated circuits, you'll need to talk to your Microsoft Account team about how to get authorization to use the **Other Office 365 Online service (12076:5100)** community. The MS Office-managed review board will verify whether you need those circuits and make sure you understand the technical implications of keeping them. Unauthorized subscriptions trying to create route filters for Office 365 will receive an error message.

### Improvements to the B2B redemption experience and leave an org

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** B2B
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C

**Just in time redemption:** Once you share a resource with a guest user using B2B API – you don't need to send out a special invitation email. In most      cases, the guest user can access the resource and will be taken through the redemption experience just in time. No more impact due to missed emails. No more asking your guest users "Did you click on that redemption link the system sent you?". This means once SPO uses the invitation manager – cloudy attachments can have the same canonical URL for all users – internal and external – in any state of redemption.

**Modern redemption experience:** No more split screen redemption landing page. Users will see a modern consent experience with the inviting organization's privacy statement, just like they do for third-party apps.

**Guest users can leave the org:** Once a user's relationship with an org is over, they can self-serve leaving the organization. No more calling the inviting org's admin to "be removed", no more raising support tickets.

### ID tokens can no longer be returned using the query response_mode for new apps.

**Type:** Changed feature
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Apps created on or after April 25, 2018 will no longer be able to request an **id_token** using the **query** response_mode.  This brings Azure AD inline with the OIDC specifications and helps reduce your apps attack surface.  Apps created before April 25, 2018 are not blocked from using the **query** response_mode with a response_type of **id_token**.  The error returned, when requesting an id_token from Azure AD, is **AADSTS70007: 'query' is not a supported value of 'response_mode' when requesting a token**.

The **fragment** and **form_post** response_modes continue to work - when creating new application objects (for example, for App Proxy usage), ensure use of one of these response_modes before they create a new application.

### Faster performance of Azure AD automatic user provisioning to SaaS applications

**Type:** Changed feature
**Service category:** App Provisioning
**Product capability:** 3rd Party Integration

Previously, customers using the Azure Active Directory user provisioning connectors for SaaS applications (for example Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Box) could experience slow performance if their Azure AD tenants contained over 100,000 combined users and groups, and they were using user and group assignments to determine which users should be provisioned.

On April 2, 2018, significant performance enhancements were deployed to the Azure AD provisioning service that greatly reduce the amount of time needed to perform initial synchronizations between Azure Active Directory and target SaaS applications.

As a result, many customers that had initial synchronizations to apps that took many days or never completed, are now completing within a matter of minutes or hours.

For more information, see [What happens during provisioning?](../..//active-directory/app-provisioning/how-provisioning-works.md)

### Azure AD app-based Conditional Access

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** Azure AD
**Product capability:** Identity security and protection

You now can restrict access to Office 365 and other Azure AD-connected cloud apps to [approved client apps](../conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions.md#client-apps) that support Intune app protection policies by using [Azure AD app-based Conditional Access](../conditional-access/app-based-conditional-access.md). Intune app protection policies are used to configure and protect company data on these client applications.

By combining [app-based](../conditional-access/app-based-conditional-access.md) with [device-based](../conditional-access/require-managed-devices.md) Conditional Access policies, you have the flexibility to protect data for personal and company devices.

The following conditions and controls are now available for use with app-based Conditional Access:

**Supported platform condition**

- iOS
- Android

**Client apps condition**

- Mobile apps and desktop clients

**Access control**

- Require approved client app

For more information, see [Azure AD app-based Conditional Access](../conditional-access/app-based-conditional-access.md).

### Support for macOS as a device platform for Azure AD Conditional Access

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** Conditional Access
**Product capability:** Identity security and protection

You now can include (or exclude) macOS as a device platform condition in your Azure AD Conditional Access policy. With the addition of macOS to the supported device platforms, you can:

- **Enroll and manage macOS devices by using Intune.** Similar to other platforms like iOS and Android, a company portal application is available for macOS to do unified enrollments. You can use the new company portal app for macOS to enroll a device with Intune and register it with Azure AD.
- **Ensure macOS devices adhere to your organization's compliance policies defined in Intune.** In Intune on the Azure portal, you now can set up compliance policies for macOS devices.
- **Restrict access to applications in Azure AD to only compliant macOS devices.** Conditional Access policy authoring has macOS as a separate device platform option. Now you can author macOS-specific Conditional Access policies for the targeted application set in Azure.

For more information, see:

- [Create a device compliance policy for macOS devices with Intune](/mem/intune/protect/compliance-policy-create-mac-os)

### Network Policy Server extension for Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:**  Multifactor authentication
**Product capability:** User authentication

The Network Policy Server extension for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Multi-Factor Authentication adds cloud-based multifactor authentication capabilities to your authentication infrastructure by using your existing servers. With the Network Policy Server extension, you can add phone call, text message, or phone app verification to your existing authentication flow. You don't have to install, configure, and maintain new servers.

This extension was created for organizations that want to protect virtual private network connections without deploying the Azure Active Directory Multi-Factor Authentication Server. The Network Policy Server extension acts as an adapter between RADIUS and cloud-based Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication to provide a second factor of authentication for federated or synced users.

For more information, see [Integrate your existing Network Policy Server infrastructure with Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication](../authentication/howto-mfa-nps-extension.md).

### Use "OR" between controls in a Conditional Access policy

**Type:** Changed feature
**Service category:** Conditional Access
**Product capability:** Identity security and protection

You now can use "OR" (require one of the selected controls) for Conditional Access controls. You can use this feature to create policies with "OR" between access controls. For example, you can use this feature to create a policy that requires a user to sign in by using multifactor authentication "OR" to be on a compliant device.

For more information, see [Controls in Azure AD Conditional Access](../conditional-access/controls.md).

### Aggregation of real-time risk detections

**Type:** Changed feature
**Service category:** Identity protection
**Product capability:** Identity security and protection

In Azure AD Identity Protection, all real-time risk detections that originated from the same IP address on a given day are now aggregated for each risk detection type. This change limits the volume of risk detections shown without any change in user security.

The underlying real-time detection works each time the user signs in. If you have a sign-in risk security policy set up to multifactor authentication or block access, it is still triggered during each risky sign-in.
