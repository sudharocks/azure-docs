## January 2023

### Public Preview - Cross-tenant synchronization



**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Provisioning               
**Product capability:** Collaboration          

Cross-tenant synchronization allows you to set up a scalable and automated solution for users to access applications across tenants in your organization. It builds upon the Azure AD B2B functionality and automates creating, updating, and deleting B2B users. For more information, see: [What is cross-tenant synchronization? (preview)](../multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-overview.md).

### Public Preview - Devices Blade Self-Help Capability for Pending Devices



**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Device Access Management                
**Product capability:** End User Experiences          

In the **All Devices** blade under the registered column, you can now select any pending devices you have, and it will open a context pane to help troubleshoot why the device may be pending.

### General Availability - Apple Watch companion app removed from Authenticator for iOS



**Type:**  Deprecated      
**Service category:** Identity Protection                
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection          

In the January 2023 release of Authenticator for iOS, there will be no companion app for watchOS due to it being incompatible with Authenticator security features. This means you won't be able to install or use Authenticator on Apple Watch. This change only impacts Apple Watch, so you'll still be able to use Authenticator on your other devices. For more information, see: [Common questions about the Microsoft Authenticator app](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/common-questions-about-the-microsoft-authenticator-app-12d283d1-bcef-4875-9ae5-ac360e2945dd).

**Service category:** Provisioning            
**Product capability:** Outbound to On-premises Applications        

Azure AD supports provisioning users into applications hosted on-premises or in a virtual machine, without having to open up any firewalls. If your application supports [SCIM](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/identity-standards-blog/provisioning-with-scim-getting-started/ba-p/880010), or you've built a SCIM gateway to connect to your legacy application, you can use the Azure AD Provisioning agent to [directly connect](../app-provisioning/on-premises-scim-provisioning.md) with your application and automate provisioning and deprovisioning. If you have legacy applications that don't support SCIM and rely on an [LDAP](../app-provisioning/on-premises-ldap-connector-configure.md) user store, or a [SQL](../app-provisioning/tutorial-ecma-sql-connector.md) database, Azure AD can support those as well.

### ADAL End of Support Announcement

**Type:** N/A      
**Service category:** Other               
**Product capability:** Developer Experience         

As part of our ongoing initiative to improve the developer experience, service reliability, and security of customer applications, we will end support for the Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL). The final deadline to migrate your applications to Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) has been extended to **June 30, 2023**. 

### Why are we doing this?

As we consolidate and evolve the Microsoft Identity platform, we are also investing in making significant improvements to the developer experience and service features that make it possible to build secure, robust and resilient applications. To make these features available to our customers we needed to update the architecture of our software development kits. As a result of this change, we’ve decided that the path forward requires us to sunset ADAL so that we can focus on developer experience investments with MSAL. 

### What happens?

We recognize that changing libraries is not an easy task, and cannot be accomplished quickly. We are committed to helping customers plan their migrations to MSAL as well as execute them with minimal disruption.

- In June 2020 we [announced the 2-year end of support timeline for ADAL](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/end-of-support-timelines-for-azure-ad-authentication-library-adal-and-azure-ad-graph/). 
- In December 2022 we’ve decided to extend the ADAL end of support to June 2023. 
- Through the next six months (January 2023 – June 2023) we will continue informing customers about the upcoming end of support along with providing guidance on migration. 
- On June 2023 we will officially sunset ADAL, removing library documentation and archiving all GitHub repositories related to the project. 

### How to find out which applications in my tenant are using ADAL?

Refer to our post on [Microsoft Q&A](/answers/questions/360928/information-how-to-find-apps-using-adal-in-your-te.html) for details on identifying ADAL apps with the help of [Azure Workbooks](../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md). 
### If I’m using ADAL, what can I expect after the deadline? 

- There will be no new releases (security or otherwise) to the library after June 2023. 
- We will not be accepting any incident reports or support requests for ADAL. ADAL to MSAL migration support would continue.   
- The underpinning services will continue working and applications that depend on ADAL should continue working; however, applications and the resources they access will be at increased security and reliability risk due to not having the latest updates, service configuration, and enhancements made available through the Microsoft Identity platform. 

### What features can I only access with MSAL?
 
The number of features and capabilities that we are adding to MSAL libraries are growing weekly. Some of them include: 
- Support for Microsoft accounts (MSA) 
- Support for Azure AD B2C accounts 
- Handling throttling 
- Proactive token refresh and token revocation based on policy or critical events for Microsoft Graph and other APIs that support [Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)](../develop/app-resilience-continuous-access-evaluation.md)
- Auth broker support with device-based conditional access policies 
- Azure AD hardware-based certificate authentication (CBA) on mobile  
- System browsers on mobile devices 
And more. For an up-to-date list, refer to our [migration guide](../develop/msal-migration.md#how-to-migrate-to-msal). 

### How to migrate? 

To make the migration process easier we published a [comprehensive guide](../develop/msal-migration.md#how-to-migrate-to-msal) that documents the migration paths across different platforms and programming languages. 

In addition to the ADAL to MSAL update, we recommend migrating from Azure AD Graph API to Microsoft Graph. This change will enable you to take advantage of the latest additions and enhancements, such as CAE, across the Microsoft service offering through a single, unified endpoint. You can read more in our [Migrate your apps from Azure AD Graph to Microsoft Graph](/graph/migrate-azure-ad-graph-overview) guide. Any questions can be posted to [Microsoft Q&A](/answers/topics/azure-active-directory.html) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/msal)

### Public Preview - IPv6 coming to Azure AD



**Type:** Plan for change      
**Service category:** Identity Protection            
**Product capability:** Platform     

With the growing adoption and support of IPv6 across enterprise networks, service providers, and devices, many customers are wondering if their users can continue to access their services and applications from IPv6 clients and networks. Today, we’re excited to announce our plan to bring IPv6 support to Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This will allow customers to reach the Azure AD services over both IPv4 and IPv6 network protocols (dual stack).
For most customers, IPv4 won't completely disappear from their digital landscape, so we aren't planning to require IPv6 or to de-prioritize IPv4 in any Azure Active Directory features or services.
We'll begin introducing IPv6 support into Azure AD services in a phased approach, beginning March 31, 2023.
We have guidance below which is specifically for Azure AD customers who use IPv6 addresses and also use Named Locations in their Conditional Access policies.

Customers who use named locations to identify specific network boundaries in their organization need to:
1. Conduct an audit of existing named locations to anticipate potential impact.
1. Work with your network partner to identify egress IPv6 addresses in use in your environment.
1. Review and update existing named locations to include the identified IPv6 ranges.

Customers who use Conditional Access location based policies to restrict and secure access to their apps from specific networks need to:
1. Conduct an audit of existing Conditional Access policies to identify use of named locations as a condition to anticipate potential impact.
1. Review and update existing Conditional Access location based policies to ensure they continue to meet your organization’s security requirements.

We'll continue to share additional guidance on IPv6 enablement in Azure AD at this easy to remember link https://aka.ms/azureadipv6.
