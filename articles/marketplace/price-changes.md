# Changing prices in active commercial marketplace offers

The price change feature allows publishers to change the prices of marketplace offers transacted through Microsoft. This article describes how to change the price of an offer.

Publishers can update the prices of previously published plans and publish the price changes to the marketplace. Microsoft schedules price changes in the future to align with future billing cycles.

If the price of an offer increased, existing customers of the offer receive an email notification prior to the increase becoming effective. The product listing page on Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace will start displaying a notice of the upcoming increased price.

Once the price change becomes effective, customers will be billed at the new price. If locked into a contract, they will continue to receive the contract price for the length of the contract term. Contract renewals will receive the new price.

The price change experience for publishers and customers:

### Feature benefits

The price change feature provides the following benefits:

- **Easy to change prices** – Publishers can increase or decrease the prices of offers without having to create a new plan with the new price and retire the previous plan, including offers published solely to the preview phase.
- **Automatic billing of the new price** – Once the price change becomes effective, existing customers will automatically be billed the new price without any action needed on their part.
- **Customer notifications** – Customers will be notified of price increases through email and on the product listing page of the marketplace.

### Sample scenarios

The price change feature supports the following scenarios:

- Increase or decrease the [monthly/yearly flat fee](#changing-the-flat-fee-of-a-saas-or-azure-app-offer).
- Increase or decrease the [per-user monthly/yearly SaaS fee](#changing-the-per-user-fee-of-a-saas-offer).
- Increase or decrease the [price per unit of a meter dimension](#changing-the-meter-dimension-of-a-saas-or-azure-app-offer).
- Increase or decrease the [price per vCPU or per vCPU size](#changing-the-vcpu-price-of-a-virtual-machine).
   
### Supported offer types

The ability to change prices is available for both public and private plans of offers transacted through Microsoft.

Supported offer types:
- Azure application (Managed App)
- Software as a service (SaaS)
- Azure virtual machine.

Price changes for the following offer types are not yet supported:
- Dynamics 365 apps on Dataverse and Power Apps
- Power BI visual
- Azure container

### Unsupported scenarios and limitations

The price change feature does not support the following scenarios:

- Price changes on hidden plans.
- Price changes on plans available in Azure Government cloud.
- Price increase and decrease on the same plan. To make both changes, first schedule the price decrease. Once it becomes effective, publish the price increase. See [Plan for a price change](#plan-a-price-change) below.
- Changing prices from free or $0 to paid.
- Changing prices via APIs.

Price changes will go through full certification. To avoid delays in scheduling it, don't make other changes to the offer along with the price change.

## Plan a price change

When planning a price change, consider the following:

| Consideration | Impact | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type of price change | This dictates how far into the future the price will be scheduled. | - Price decreases are scheduled for the first of the next month.<br> - Price increases are scheduled for the first of a future month, at least 90 days after the price change is published.<br> |
| Offer type | This dictates when you need to publish the price change via Partner Center. | Price changes must be published before the cut-off times below to be scheduled for the next month (based on type of price change):<br> - Software as a service offer: Four days before the end of the month.<br> - Virtual machine offer: Six days before the end of the month.<br> - Azure application offer: 14 days before the end of the month.<br> |

#### Examples

For a price decrease to a Software as a service offer to take effect on the first of the next month, publish the price change at least four days before the end of the current month.

For a price increase to a Software as a service offer to take effect on the first of a future month, 90 days out, publish the price change at least four days before the end of the current month.
> [!Note]
> Offers will be billed to customers in the customers’ agreement currency, using the local market price that was published at the time the offer was created. The amount that customers pay, and that ISVs are paid, depends on the Foreign Exchange rates at the time the customer transacts the offer.

## Canceling or modifying a price change

If the price change was configured within the last 2 days, it can be canceled using the cancel button next to the price change expected on date and then publishing the changes. For a price change configured more than 2 days ago that has not yet taken effect, [submit a support request](https://partner.microsoft.com/support/?stage=1) that includes the Plan ID, price, and the market (if the change was market specific) in the request. 
If the price change was an increase and the cancelation was after the 2-day period, we will email the customers a second time to inform them of the cancelation.
After the price change is canceled, follow the steps in the appropriate part of this article to schedule a new price change with the needed modifications.
