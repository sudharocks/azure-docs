# Update vCPU sizes for an Azure virtual machine offer

Complete these steps when you are notified that new vCPU sizes are now supported.

> [!NOTE]
> These steps apply regardless of the selected price input option (free, flat ate, per vCPU, per vCPU size, per market and vCPU size) and must be completed within the period specified in the notification from Microsoft. Otherwise, weâ€™ll publish the new vCPU sizes at the price that we calculate for you.

1. Sign-in to [Partner Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2166002).
1. On the Home page, select the **Marketplace offers** tile.

1. On the **Overview** page, select your VM offer.
1. On the **Offer overview** page, under **Plan overview**, select a plan within your offer.
1. In the left-nav menu, select **Pricing and availability**.
1. Do one of the following:
    - If either the _Per_ *vCPU* _size_ or _Per market and_ vCPU _size_ price entry options are used, under **Pricing**, verify the price and make any necessary adjustments for the new vCPU sizes that have been added.
    - If your price entry option is set to _Free_, _Flat rate_, or _Per_ *vCPU*, go to step 7.
   
1. Select **Save draft** and then **Review and publish**. After the offer is republished, the new vCPU sizes will be available to your customers at the prices that you have set.
