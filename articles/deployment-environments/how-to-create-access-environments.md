# Create and access an environment by using the Azure CLI

This article shows you how to create and access an [environment](concept-environments-key-concepts.md#environments) in an existing Azure Deployment Environments Preview project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Deployment Environments currently is in preview. For legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, in preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability, see the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Prerequisites

- [Create and configure a dev center](quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter.md).
- [Create and configure a project](quickstart-create-and-configure-projects.md).
- Install the Azure Deployment Environments Azure CLI extension:

  1. [Download and install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
  1. Install the Azure Deployment Environments AZ CLI extension:

     **Automated installation**
  
     In PowerShell, run the https://aka.ms/DevCenter/Install-DevCenterCli.ps1 script:

     ```powershell
     iex "& { $(irm https://aka.ms/DevCenter/Install-DevCenterCli.ps1 ) }"
     ```
  
     The script uninstalls any existing dev center extension and installs the latest version.

     **Manual installation**
  
     Run the following command in the Azure CLI:

     ```azurecli
     az extension add --source https://fidalgosetup.blob.core.windows.net/cli-extensions/devcenter-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
     ```

## Create an environment

Complete the following steps in the Azure CLI to create an environment and configure resources. You can view the outputs as defined in the specific Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template).

> [!NOTE]
> Only a user who has the [Deployment Environments User](how-to-configure-deployment-environments-user.md) role, the [DevCenter Project Admin](how-to-configure-project-admin.md) role, or a [built-in role](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) that has appropriate permissions can create an environment.


1. Sign in to the Azure CLI:

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

1. List all the Azure Deployment Environments projects you have access to:

   ```azurecli
   az graph query -q "Resources | where type =~ 'microsoft.devcenter/projects'" -o table
   ```

1. Configure the default subscription as the subscription that contains the project:

   ```azurecli
   az account set --subscription <name>
   ```

1. Configure the default resource group as the resource group that contains the project:

   ```azurecli
   az config set defaults.group=<name>
   ```  

1. List the type of environments you can create in a specific project:

   ```azurecli
   az devcenter dev environment-type list --dev-center <name> --project-name <name> -o table
   ```

1. List the [catalog items](concept-environments-key-concepts.md#catalog-items) that are available to a specific project:

   ```azurecli
   az devcenter dev catalog-item list --dev-center <name> --project-name <name> -o table
   ```

1. Create an environment by using a *catalog-item* (an infrastructure-as-code template defined in the [manifest.yaml](configure-catalog-item.md#add-a-new-catalog-item) file) from the list of available catalog items:

   ```azurecli
   az devcenter dev environment create --dev-center-name <devcenter-name> 
       --project-name <project-name> --environment-type <environment-type-name> 
       --catalog-item-name <catalog-item-name> --catalog-name <catalog-name> 
   ```

    If the specific *catalog-item* requires any parameters, use `--parameters` and provide the parameters as a JSON string or a JSON file. For example:

   ```json
   $params = "{ 'name': 'firstMsi', 'location': 'northeurope' }"
   az devcenter dev environment create --dev-center-name <devcenter-name> 
       --project-name <project-name> -n <name> --environment-type <environment-type-name> 
       --catalog-item-name <catalog-item-name> --catalog-name <catalog-name> 
       --parameters $params
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use `--help` to view more details about any command, accepted arguments and examples. For example, use `az devcenter dev environment create --help` to view more details about creating an environment.

### Troubleshoot permission error

You must have the [Deployment Environments User](how-to-configure-deployment-environments-user.md) role, the [DevCenter Project Admin](how-to-configure-project-admin.md) role, or a [built-in role](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) that has appropriate permissions can create an environment.

If you don't have the correct permissions, creation of the environment will fail, and you may receive an error message like this:

```
(EnvironmentNotFound) The environment resource was not found.
Code: EnvironmentNotFound
Message: The environment resource was not found.
```

To resolve the issue, assign the correct permissions: [Give project access to the development team](quickstart-create-and-configure-projects.md#give-project-access-to-the-development-team).

## Access an environment

To access an environment:

1. List existing environments that are available in a specific project:

   ```azurecli
    az devcenter dev environment list --dev-center <devcenter-name> --project-name <project-name>
   ```  

1. View the access endpoints to various resources as defined in the ARM template outputs.
1. Access the specific resources by using the endpoints.
