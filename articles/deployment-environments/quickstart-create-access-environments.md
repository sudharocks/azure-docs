## Prerequisites

- [Create and configure a dev center](quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter.md).
- [Create and configure a project](quickstart-create-and-configure-projects.md).

## Create an environment
You can create an environment from the developer portal. 

> [!NOTE]
> Only a user who has the [Deployment Environments User](how-to-configure-deployment-environments-user.md) role, the [DevCenter Project Admin](how-to-configure-project-admin.md) role, or a [built-in role](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) that has appropriate permissions can create an environment.

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://devportal.microsoft.com).
1. From the **New** menu at the top right, select **New environment**.

   |Field  |Value  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Name     | Enter a descriptive name for your environment. |
   |Project  | Select the project you want to create the environment in. If you have access to more than one project, you'll see a list of the available projects. |
   |Type     | Select the environment type you want to create. If you have access to more than one environment type, you'll see a list of the available types. |

If your environment is configured to accept parameters, you'll be able to enter them on a separate pane. In this example, you don't need to specify any parameters.

1. Select **Create**. You'll see your environment in the developer portal immediately, with an indicator that shows creation in progress.
 
## Access an environment
You can access and manage your environments in the Microsoft Developer portal.

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://devportal.microsoft.com).

1. You'll be able to view all of your existing environments. To access the specific resources created as part of an Environment, select the **Environment Resources** link.
