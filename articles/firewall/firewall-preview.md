# Azure Firewall preview features

The following Azure Firewall preview features are available publicly for you to deploy and test. Some of the preview features are available on the Azure portal, and some are only visible using a feature flag.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These features are currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Feature flags

As new features are released to preview, some of them will be behind a feature flag. To enable the functionality in your environment, you must enable the feature flag on your subscription. These features are applied at the subscription level for all firewalls (VNet firewalls and SecureHub firewalls).  

This article will be updated to reflect the features that are currently in preview with instructions to enable them. When the features move to General Availability (GA), they'll be available to all customers without the need to enable a feature flag. 

## Preview features

The following features are available in preview.

### Network rule name logging (preview)

With this new feature, the event logs for network rules adds the following attributes:
   - Policy name
   - Rule collection group
   - Rule collection
   - Rule name 

For more information, see [Azure Firewall network rule name logging (preview)](firewall-network-rule-logging.md).

### Structured Firewall Logs (preview)

With Structured Firewall Logs, you'll be able to choose to use Resource Specific tables instead of an existing AzureDiagnostics table. Structured Firewall Logs is required for Policy Analytics. This new method helps you with better log querying and is recommended because:

- It's easier to work with the data in the log queries
- It's easier to discover schemas and their structure
- It improves performance across both ingestion latency and query times
- It allows you to grant Azure RBAC rights on a specific table

For more information, see [Azure Structured Firewall Logs (preview)](firewall-structured-logs.md).

### Policy Analytics (preview)

Policy Analytics provides insights, centralized visibility, and control to Azure Firewall. IT teams today are challenged to keep Firewall rules up to date, manage existing rules, and remove unused rules. Any accidental rule updates can lead to a significant downtime for IT teams.

For more information, see [Azure Firewall Policy Analytics (preview)](policy-analytics.md).

### Easy upgrade/downgrade (preview)

You can now easily upgrade your existing Firewall Standard SKU to Premium SKU and downgrade from Premium to Standard SKU. The process is fully automated and has no service impact (zero service downtime).

For more information, see [Azure Firewall easy upgrade/downgrade (preview)](easy-upgrade.md).
