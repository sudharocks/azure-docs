[Reference documentation](/javascript/api/overview/azure/ai-text-analytics-readme?preserve-view=true&view=azure-node-latest) | [Additional samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/ai-text-analytics/samples) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/ai-text-analytics/v/5.1.0) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/textanalytics/ai-text-analytics) 

Use this quickstart to create a Text Analytics for health application with the client library for Node.js. In the following example, you will create a JavaScript application that can identify medical [entities](../../concepts/health-entity-categories.md), [relations](../../concepts/relation-extraction.md), and [assertions](../../concepts/assertion-detection.md) that appear in text.


## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14 LTS or later
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics"  title="Create a Language resource"  target="_blank">create a Language resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`Free F0`) to try the service (providing 5000 text records - 1000 characters each) and upgrade later to the `Standard S` pricing tier for production. You can also start with the `Standard S` pricing tier, receiving the same initial quota for free (5000 text records) before getting charged. For more information on pricing, visit [Language Service Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/language-service/).

## Setting up

### Create a new Node.js application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

```console
mkdir myapp 

cd myapp
```

Run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a `package.json` file. 

```console
npm init
```

### Install the client library

Install the npm package:

```console
npm install --save @azure/ai-text-analytics@5.1.0
```

## Code example

Open the file and copy the below code. Remember to replace the `key` variable with the key for your resource, and replace the `endpoint` variable with the endpoint for your resource. Then run the code.  

[!INCLUDE [find the key and endpoint for a resource](../../../includes/find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```javascript
"use strict";

const { TextAnalyticsClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-text-analytics");
const key = '<paste-your-key-here>';
const endpoint = '<paste-your-endpoint-here>';
// Authenticate the client with your key and endpoint.
const textAnalyticsClient = new TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(key));

// Example method for extracting information from healthcare-related text.
async function healthExample(client) {
    console.log("== Recognize Healthcare Entities Sample ==");

    const documents = [
        "Prescribed 100mg ibuprofen, taken twice daily."
    ];
    const poller = await client.beginAnalyzeHealthcareEntities(documents, "en", {
        includeStatistics: true
    });

    poller.onProgress(() => {
        console.log(
            `Last time the operation was updated was on: ${poller.getOperationState().lastModifiedOn}`
        );
    });
    console.log(
        `The analyze healthcare entities operation was created on ${poller.getOperationState().createdOn
        }`
    );
    console.log(
        `The analyze healthcare entities operation results will expire on ${poller.getOperationState().expiresOn
        }`
    );

    const results = await poller.pollUntilDone();

    for await (const result of results) {
        console.log(`- Document ${result.id}`);
        if (!result.error) {
            console.log("\tRecognized Entities:");
            for (const entity of result.entities) {
                console.log(`\t- Entity "${entity.text}" of type ${entity.category}`);
            }
            if (result.entityRelations && (result.entityRelations.length > 0)) {
                console.log(`\tRecognized relations between entities:`);
                for (const relation of result.entityRelations) {
                    console.log(
                        `\t\t- Relation of type ${relation.relationType} found between the following entities:`
                    );
                    for (const role of relation.roles) {
                        console.log(`\t\t\t- "${role.entity.text}" with the role ${role.name}`);
                    }
                }
            }
        } else console.error("\tError:", result.error);
    }
}

healthExample(textAnalyticsClient).catch((err) => {
    console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
});
```

### Output

```console
- Document 0
    Recognized Entities:
    - Entity "100mg" of type Dosage
    - Entity "ibuprofen" of type MedicationName
    - Entity "twice daily" of type Frequency

        - Relation of type FrequencyOfMedication found between the following entities:
                - "ibuprofen" with the role Medication

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Portal](../../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md#clean-up-resources)
* [Azure CLI](../../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md#clean-up-resources)
