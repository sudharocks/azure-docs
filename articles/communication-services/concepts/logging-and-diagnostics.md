# Communication Services logs

Azure Communication Services offers logging capabilities that you can use to monitor and debug your Communication Services solution. These capabilities can be configured through the Azure portal.

 >[!IMPORTANT]
 > For Audio/Video/Telephony call data refer to [Call Summary and Call Diagnostic Logs](../concepts/analytics/call-logs-azure-monitor.md)

## Enable diagnostic logs in your resource

Logging is turned off by default when a resource is created. To enable logging, navigate to the **Diagnostic settings** tab in the resource menu under the **Monitoring** section. Then select **Add diagnostic setting**.

Next, select the archive target you want. Currently, we support storage accounts and Log Analytics as archive targets. After selecting the types of logs that you'd like to capture, save the diagnostic settings.
 
New settings take effect in about 10 minutes. Logs will begin appearing in the configured archival target within the Logs pane of your Communication Services resource.

For more information about configuring diagnostics, see the overview of [Azure resource logs](../../azure-monitor/essentials/platform-logs-overview.md).

## Resource log categories

Communication Services offers the following types of logs that you can enable:

* **Usage logs** - provides usage data associated with each billed service offering
* **Chat operational logs** - provides basic information related to the chat service
* **SMS operational logs** - provides basic information related to the SMS service
* **Authentication operational logs** - provides basic information related to the Authentication service
* **Network Traversal operational logs** - provides basic information related to the Network Traversal service
* **Email Send Mail operational logs** - provides detailed information related to the Email service send mail requests.
* **Email Status Update operational logs** - provides message and recipient level delivery status updates related to the Email service send mail requests.
* **Email User Engagement operational logs** - provides information related to 'open' and 'click' user engagement metrics for messages sent from the Email service.
* **Call Automation operational logs** - provides operational information on Call Automation API requests. These logs can be used to identify failure points, query all requests made in a call (using Correlation ID or Server Call ID) or query all requests made by a specific service application in the call (using Participant ID).

### Usage logs schema

| -------- | ---------------|
| Timestamp | The timestamp (UTC) of when the log was generated. |
| Operation Name | The operation associated with log record. |
