# Connect to and manage Azure Data Explorer in Microsoft Purview


This article outlines how to register Azure Data Explorer, and how to authenticate and interact with Azure Data Explorer in Microsoft Purview. For more information about Microsoft Purview, read the [introductory article](overview.md).

## Supported capabilities

|**Metadata Extraction**|  **Full Scan**  |**Incremental Scan**|**Scoped Scan**|**Classification**|**Access Policy**|**Lineage**|**Data Sharing**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Yes](#register) | [Yes](#scan) | [Yes](#scan) | [Yes](#scan)| [Yes](#scan)| No | Limited* | No |

\* *Lineage is supported if dataset is used as a sink in [Data Factory](how-to-link-azure-data-factory.md) or [Synapse pipeline](how-to-lineage-azure-synapse-analytics.md).*

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An active [Microsoft Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md).

* You will need to be a Data Source Administrator and Data Reader to register a source and manage it in the Microsoft Purview governance portal. See our [Microsoft Purview Permissions page](catalog-permissions.md) for details.

## Register

This section describes how to register Azure Data Explorer in Microsoft Purview using the [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/).

### Authentication for registration

There are several methods available for authentication for Azure Data Explorer:

- [Service Principal](#service-principal-to-register)
- [System-assigned managed identity (SAMI)](#system-or-user-assigned-managed-identity-to-register)
- [User-assigned managed identity (UAMI)](#system-or-user-assigned-managed-identity-to-register)

#### Service Principal to register

To use service principal authentication for scans, you can use an existing one or create a new one.

> [!Note]
> If you have to create a new Service Principal, please follow these steps:
> 1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
> 1. Select **Azure Active Directory** from the left-hand side menu.
> 1. Select **App registrations**.
> 1. Select **+ New application registration**.
> 1. Enter a name for the **application** (the service principal name).
> 1. Select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
> 1. For Redirect URI select **Web** and enter any URL you want; it doesn't have to be real or work.
> 1. Then select **Register**.

It is required to get the Service Principal's application ID and secret:

1. Navigate to your Service Principal in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
1. Copy the values the **Application (client) ID** from **Overview** and **Client secret** from **Certificates & secrets**.
1. Navigate to your key vault
1. Select **Settings > Secrets**
1. Select **+ Generate/Import** and enter the **Name** of your choice and **Value** as the **Client secret** from your Service Principal
1. Select **Create** to complete
1. If your key vault is not connected to Microsoft Purview yet, you will need to [create a new key vault connection](manage-credentials.md#create-azure-key-vaults-connections-in-your-microsoft-purview-account)
1. Finally, [create a new credential](manage-credentials.md#create-a-new-credential) using the Service Principal to set up your scan

#### Granting the Service Principal access to your Azure data explorer instance

1. Navigate to the Azure portal. Then navigate to your Azure data explorer instance.

1. Add the service principal to the **AllDatabasesViewer** role in the **Permissions** tab.

### System or user assigned managed identity to register

* **System-assigned managed identity** - As soon as the Microsoft Purview Account is created, a system-assigned managed identity (SAMI) is created automatically in Azure AD tenant. It has the same name as your Microsoft Purview account.

* **User-assigned managed identity** (preview) - Similar to a system-managed identity, a user-assigned managed identity (UAMI) is a credential resource that can be used to allow Microsoft Purview to authenticate against Azure Active Directory. For more information, you can see our [User-assigned managed identity guide](manage-credentials.md#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity).

To register using either of these managed identities, follow these steps:

1. If you would like to use a user-assigned managed identity and have not created one, follow the steps to create the identity in the [User-assigned managed identity guide](manage-credentials.md#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity).

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Then navigate to your Azure data explorer instance.

1. Select the **Permissions** tab on the left pane.

1. Add the SAMI or UAMI to the **AllDatabasesViewer** role in the **Permissions** tab.
