# Scan data sources in Microsoft Purview

In Microsoft Purview, after you [register your data source](manage-data-sources.md#register-a-new-source), you can scan your source to capture technical metadata, extract schema, and apply classifications to your data.

* For more information about scanning in general, see our [scanning concept article](concept-scans-and-ingestion.md).
* For best practices, see our [scanning best practices article.](concept-best-practices-scanning.md)

In this article, you'll learn the basic steps for scanning any data source.

>[!TIP]
>Each source has its own instructions and prerequisites for scanning. For the most complete scanning instructions, select your source from the [supported sources list](microsoft-purview-connector-overview.md) and review its scanning instructions.

## Prerequisites

[Here's a list of all the sources that are currently available to register and scan in Microsoft Purview.](microsoft-purview-connector-overview.md)

Before you can scan your data source, you must take these steps:

1. [Register your data source](manage-data-sources.md#register-a-new-source) - This essentially gives Microsoft Purview the address of your data source, and maps it to a [collection](catalog-permissions.md#a-collections-example) in the Microsoft Purview Data Map.
1. Consider your network - If your source is in an on-premises network, or a virtual private network (VPN), or if your [Microsoft Purview account is using private endpoints](catalog-private-link-end-to-end.md), you'll need a self-hosted integration runtime, which is a tool that will sit on a machine in your private network so your source and Microsoft Purview can connect during the scan. [Here are the instructions to create a self-hosted integration runtime.](manage-integration-runtimes.md)
1. Consider what credentials you're going to use to connect to your source. All [source pages](microsoft-purview-connector-overview.md) will have a **Scan** section that will include details about what authentication types are available.

## Create a scan

In the steps below we'll be using [Azure Blob Storage](register-scan-azure-blob-storage-source.md) as an example, and authenticating with the Microsoft Purview Managed Identity.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> These are the general steps for creating a scan, but you should refer to [the source page](microsoft-purview-connector-overview.md) for source-specific prerequistes and scanning instructions.


1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your **Microsoft Purview account** and select the **Open Microsoft Purview governance portal** button.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/scan-data-sources/open-purview-studio.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Microsoft Purview window in Azure portal, with the Microsoft Purview governance portal button highlighted." border="true":::

1. Navigate to the **Data map** -> **Sources** to view your registered sources either in a map or table view.
1. Find your source and select the **New Scan** icon.

   :::image type="content" source="media/scan-data-sources/register-blob-new-scan.png" alt-text="Screenshot the new scan button highlighted by a registered source and the new scan window.":::

1. Provide a **Name** for the scan.
1. Select your authentication method. Here we chose the Purview MSI (managed identity.)

   :::image type="content" source="media/scan-data-sources/register-blob-managed-identity.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the managed identity option to run the scan.":::

1. Choose the current collection, or a sub collection for the scan. The collection you choose will house the metadata discovered during the scan.

1. Select **Test connection**. If it isn't successful, see our [troubleshooting] section. On a successful connection, select **Continue**.

1. Depending on the source, you can scope your scan to a specific subset of data. For Azure Blob Storage, we can select folders and subfolders by choosing the appropriate items in the list.

   :::image type="content" source="media/scan-data-sources/register-blob-scope-scan.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the scope your scan window with files and folders selected.":::

1. Select a scan rule set. The scan rule set contains the kinds of data [classifications](concept-classification.md) your scan will check for. You can choose between the system default (that will contain all classifications available for the source), existing custom rule sets made by others in your organization, or [create a new rule set inline](create-a-scan-rule-set.md).

   :::image type="content" source="media/scan-data-sources/register-blob-scan-rule-set.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the select a scan rule set page with the default set selected.":::

1. Choose your scan trigger. You can set up a schedule (monthly or weekly) or run the scan once.

   :::image type="content" source="media/scan-data-sources/register-blob-scan-trigger.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the set a scan trigger page showing a recurring monthly schedule.":::

1. Review your scan and select **Save and run**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/scan-data-sources/register-blob-review-scan.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the scan review page with the save and run button highlighted.":::

## View a scan

Depending on the amount of data in your data source, a scan can take some time to run, so here's how you can check on progress and see results when the scan is complete.

1. Navigate to the _data source_ in the _Collection_ and select **View Details** to check the status of the scan

   :::image type="content" source="media/scan-data-sources/register-blob-view-scan.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the data map with a source's view details button highlighted.":::

1. The scan details indicate the progress of the scan in the **Last run status** and the number of assets _scanned_ and _classified_.

   :::image type="content" source="media/scan-data-sources/register-blob-scan-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a source detail page, with the assets and scans highlighted.":::

1. The **Last run status** will be updated to **In progress** and then **Completed** once the entire scan has run successfully

   :::image type="content" source="media/scan-data-sources/register-blob-scan-in-progress.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a source detail page with a scan showing an in progress status.":::

   :::image type="content" source="media/scan-data-sources/register-blob-scan-completed.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a source detail page with a scan showing a completed status.":::

## Manage a scan

After a scan is complete, it can be managed or run again.

1. Select the **Scan name** to manage the scan

   :::image type="content" source="media/scan-data-sources/register-blob-manage-scan.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a source details page with the scan name link highlighted.":::

1. You can _run the scan_ again, _edit the scan_, _delete the scan_  

   :::image type="content" source="media/scan-data-sources/register-blob-manage-scan-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a manage scan page with the run, edit, and delete buttons highlighted.":::

1. You can run a full scan, which will scan all the content in your scope, but some sources also have **incremental scan** available. Incremental scan will scan only those resources that have been updated since the last scan. Check the **supported capabilities** table in your source page to see if incremental scan is available for your source after the first scan.

   :::image type="content" source="media/scan-data-sources/register-blob-full-inc-scan.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the run scan now button showing the full and incremental scan options.":::

## Troubleshooting

Setting up the connection for your scan can complex since it's a custom set up for your network and your credentials.

If you're unable to connect to your source, follow these steps:

1. Review your [source page](microsoft-purview-connector-overview.md) prerequisites to make sure there's nothing you've missed.
1. Review your authentication option in the **Scan** section of your source page to confirm you have set up the authentication method correctly.
1. Review our [troubleshoot connections page](troubleshoot-connections.md).
1. [Create a support request](../azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request.md#go-to-help--support-from-the-global-header), so our support team can help you troubleshoot your specific environment.
