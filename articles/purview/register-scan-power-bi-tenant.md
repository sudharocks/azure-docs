# Connect to and manage a Power BI tenant in Microsoft Purview (Same Tenant)

This article outlines how to register a Power BI tenant in a **same-tenant scenario**, and how to authenticate and interact with the tenant in Microsoft Purview. For more information about Microsoft Purview, read the [introductory article](overview.md).

## Supported capabilities

|**Metadata Extraction**|  **Full Scan**  |**Incremental Scan**|**Scoped Scan**|**Classification**|**Access Policy**|**Lineage**|**Data Sharing**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Yes](#deployment-checklist)| [Yes](#deployment-checklist)| Yes | No | No | No| [Yes](how-to-lineage-powerbi.md)| No |

When scanning Power BI source, Microsoft Purview supports:

- Extracting technical metadata including:

    - Workspaces
    - Dashboards
    - Reports
    - Datasets including the tables and columns
    - Dataflows
    - Datamarts

- Fetching static lineage on assets relationships among above Power BI artifacts as well as external data source assets. Learn more from [Power BI lineage](how-to-lineage-powerbi.md).

For a list of metadata available for Power BI, see our [available metadata documentation](available-metadata.md).

### Supported scenarios for Power BI scans

|**Scenarios**  |**Microsoft Purview public access allowed/denied** |**Power BI public access allowed /denied** | **Runtime option** | **Authentication option**  | **Deployment checklist** | 
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Public access with Azure IR     |Allowed     |Allowed        |Azure Runtime      | Microsoft Purview Managed Identity | [Review deployment checklist](#deployment-checklist) |
|Public access with Self-hosted IR     |Allowed     |Allowed        |Self-hosted runtime        |Delegated authentication / Service principal| [Review deployment checklist](#deployment-checklist) |
|Private access     |Allowed     |Denied         |Self-hosted runtime        |Delegated authentication / Service principal| [Review deployment checklist](#deployment-checklist) |
|Private access     |Denied      |Allowed        |Self-hosted runtime        |Delegated authentication / Service principal| [Review deployment checklist](#deployment-checklist) |
|Private access     |Denied      |Denied         |Self-hosted runtime        |Delegated authentication / Service principal| [Review deployment checklist](#deployment-checklist) |

### Known limitations

-  If Microsoft Purview or Power BI tenant is protected behind a private endpoint, Self-hosted runtime is the only option to scan.
-  Delegated authentication and service principal are the only supported authentication options when self-hosted integration runtime is used during the scan.
-  You can create only one scan for a Power BI data source that is registered in your Microsoft Purview account.
-  If Power BI dataset schema isn't shown after scan, it's due to one of the current limitations with [Power BI Metadata scanner](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-metadata-scanning).
-  Empty workspaces are skipped.
-  Payload is currently limited to 2MB and 800 columns when scanning an asset.

    By default, the system will find the Power BI tenant that exists in the same Azure Active Directory tenant.

    :::image type="content" source="media/setup-power-bi-scan-catalog-portal/power-bi-datasource-registered.png" alt-text="Image showing the registered Power BI data source.":::

## Scan same-tenant Power BI

> [!TIP]
> To troubleshoot any issues with scanning:
> 1. Confirm you have completed the [**deployment checklist for your scenario**](#deployment-checklist).
> 1. Review our [**scan troubleshooting documentation**](register-scan-power-bi-tenant-troubleshoot.md).

### Authenticate to Power BI tenant

In Azure Active Directory Tenant, where Power BI tenant is located:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for **Azure Active Directory**.
   
2. Create a new security group in your Azure Active Directory, by following [Create a basic group and add members using Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal.md).

    > [!Tip]
    > You can skip this step if you already have a security group you want to use.

3. Select **Security** as the **Group Type**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/setup-power-bi-scan-PowerShell/security-group.png" alt-text="Screenshot of security group type.":::

4. Add relevant user to the security group:

   - If you are using **Managed Identity** as authentication method, add your Microsoft Purview managed identity to this security group. Select **Members**, then select **+ Add members**.

       :::image type="content" source="./media/setup-power-bi-scan-PowerShell/add-group-member.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to add the catalog's managed instance to group.":::

   - If you are using **delegated authentication** or **service principal** as authentication method, add your **service principal** to this security group. Select **Members**, then select **+ Add members**.

5. Search for your Microsoft Purview managed identity or service principal and select it.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/setup-power-bi-scan-PowerShell/add-catalog-to-group-by-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to add catalog by searching for its name.":::

    You should see a success notification showing you that it was added.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/setup-power-bi-scan-PowerShell/success-add-catalog-msi.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing successful addition of  catalog managed identity.":::

### Associate the security group with Power BI tenant

1. Log into the [Power BI admin portal](https://app.powerbi.com/admin-portal/tenantSettings).
   
2. Select the **Tenant settings** page.

    > [!Important]
    > You need to be a Power BI Admin to see the tenant settings page.

3. Select **Admin API settings** > **Allow service principals to use read-only Power BI admin APIs (Preview)**.
   
4. Select **Specific security groups**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/setup-power-bi-scan-PowerShell/allow-service-principals-power-bi-admin.png" alt-text="Image showing how to allow service principals to get read-only Power BI admin API permissions.":::

5. Select **Admin API settings** > **Enhance admin APIs responses with detailed metadata** > Enable the toggle to allow Microsoft Purview Data Map automatically discover the detailed metadata of Power BI datasets as part of its scans.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > After you update the Admin API settings on your power bi tenant, wait around 15 minutes before registering a scan and test connection.

    :::image type="content" source="media/setup-power-bi-scan-catalog-portal/power-bi-scan-sub-artifacts.png" alt-text="Image showing the Power BI admin portal config to enable subartifact scan.":::

    > [!Caution]
    > When you allow the security group you created (that has your Microsoft Purview managed identity as a member) to use read-only Power BI admin APIs, you also allow it to access the metadata (e.g. dashboard and report names, owners, descriptions, etc.) for all of your Power BI artifacts in this tenant. Once the metadata has been pulled into the Microsoft Purview, Microsoft Purview's permissions, not Power BI permissions, determine who can see that metadata.
  
    > [!Note]
    > You can remove the security group from your developer settings, but the metadata previously extracted won't be removed from the Microsoft Purview account. You can delete it separately, if you wish.

### Create scan for same-tenant Power BI using Azure IR and Managed Identity
This is a suitable scenario, if both Microsoft Purview and Power BI tenant are configured to allow public access in the network settings. 

To create and run a new scan, do the following:
