# Connect to and manage a Power BI tenant in Microsoft Purview (cross-tenant)

This article outlines how to register a Power BI tenant in a cross-tenant scenario, and how to authenticate and interact with the tenant in Microsoft Purview. If you're unfamiliar with the service, see [What is Microsoft Purview?](overview.md).

## Supported capabilities

|**Metadata extraction**|  **Full scan**  |**Incremental scan**|**Scoped scan**|**Classification**|**Access policy**|**Lineage**|**Data Sharing**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Yes](#deployment-checklist)| [Yes](#deployment-checklist)| Yes | No | No | No| [Yes](how-to-lineage-powerbi.md)| No|

When scanning Power BI source, Microsoft Purview supports:

- Extracting technical metadata including:

    - Workspaces
    - Dashboards
    - Reports
    - Datasets including the tables and columns
    - Dataflows
    - Datamarts

- Fetching static lineage on assets relationships among above Power BI artifacts as well as external data source assets. Learn more from [Power BI lineage](how-to-lineage-powerbi.md).

### Supported scenarios for Power BI scans

|**Scenario**  |**Microsoft Purview public access** |**Power BI public access** | **Runtime option** | **Authentication option**  | **Deployment checklist** | 
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Public access with Azure integration runtime     |Allowed     |Allowed        |Azure runtime      |Delegated authentication    | [Deployment checklist](#deployment-checklist) |
|Public access with self-hosted integration runtime     |Allowed     |Allowed        |Self-hosted runtime        |Delegated authentication / service principal | [Deployment checklist](#deployment-checklist) |

### Known limitations

- For the cross-tenant scenario, delegated authentication and service principal are the only supported authentication options for scanning.
- You can create only one scan for a Power BI data source that is registered in your Microsoft Purview account.
- If the Power BI dataset schema isn't shown after the scan, it's due to one of the current limitations with the [Power BI metadata scanner](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-metadata-scanning).
- Empty workspaces are skipped.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- An active [Microsoft Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md).
  
## Deployment checklist

## Register the Power BI tenant

1. From the options on the left, select **Data Map**.

1. Select **Register**, and then select **Power BI** as your data source.

    :::image type="content" source="media/setup-power-bi-scan-catalog-portal/select-power-bi-data-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the list of data sources available to choose.":::

1. Give your Power BI instance a friendly name. The name must be 3 to 63 characters long, and must contain only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. Spaces aren't allowed.

1. Edit the **Tenant ID** field, to replace with the cross-tenant Power BI that you want to register and scan. By default, the Power BI tenant ID that exists in the same Azure AD instance as Microsoft Purview is populated.

     :::image type="content" source="media/setup-power-bi-scan-catalog-portal/register-cross-tenant.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the registration experience for cross-tenant Power BI.":::

## Scan cross-tenant Power BI

Delegated authentication is the only supported option for cross-tenant scanning. You can use either Azure runtime or a self-hosted integration runtime to run a scan.

> [!TIP]
> To troubleshoot any issues with scanning:
> 1. Confirm you have completed the [deployment checklist for your scenario](#deployment-checklist).
> 1. Review the [scan troubleshooting documentation](register-scan-power-bi-tenant-troubleshoot.md).

### Authenticate to Power BI tenant

In Azure Active Directory Tenant, where Power BI tenant is located:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for **Azure Active Directory**.
   
2. Create a new security group in your Azure Active Directory, by following [Create a basic group and add members using Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal.md).

    > [!Tip]
    > You can skip this step if you already have a security group you want to use.

3. Select **Security** as the **Group Type**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/setup-power-bi-scan-PowerShell/security-group.png" alt-text="Screenshot of security group type.":::

4. Add your **service principal** to this security group. Select **Members**, then select **+ Add members**.

5. Search for your Microsoft Purview managed identity or service principal and select it.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/setup-power-bi-scan-PowerShell/add-catalog-to-group-by-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to add catalog by searching for its name.":::

    You should see a success notification showing you that it was added.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/setup-power-bi-scan-PowerShell/success-add-catalog-msi.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing successful addition of  catalog managed identity.":::

### Associate the security group with Power BI tenant

1. Log into the [Power BI admin portal](https://app.powerbi.com/admin-portal/tenantSettings).
   
2. Select the **Tenant settings** page.

    > [!Important]
    > You need to be a Power BI Admin to see the tenant settings page.

3. Select **Admin API settings** > **Allow service principals to use read-only Power BI admin APIs (Preview)**.
   
4. Select **Specific security groups**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/setup-power-bi-scan-PowerShell/allow-service-principals-power-bi-admin.png" alt-text="Image showing how to allow service principals to get read-only Power BI admin API permissions.":::

5. Select **Admin API settings** > **Enhance admin APIs responses with detailed metadata** > Enable the toggle to allow Microsoft Purview Data Map automatically discover the detailed metadata of Power BI datasets as part of its scans.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > After you update the Admin API settings on your power bi tenant, wait around 15 minutes before registering a scan and test connection.

    :::image type="content" source="media/setup-power-bi-scan-catalog-portal/power-bi-scan-sub-artifacts.png" alt-text="Image showing the Power BI admin portal config to enable subartifact scan.":::

    > [!Caution]
    > When you allow the security group you created (that has your Microsoft Purview managed identity as a member) to use read-only Power BI admin APIs, you also allow it to access the metadata (e.g. dashboard and report names, owners, descriptions, etc.) for all of your Power BI artifacts in this tenant. Once the metadata has been pulled into the Microsoft Purview, Microsoft Purview's permissions, not Power BI permissions, determine who can see that metadata.
  
    > [!Note]
    > You can remove the security group from your developer settings, but the metadata previously extracted won't be removed from the Microsoft Purview account. You can delete it separately, if you wish.

### Create scan for cross-tenant using Azure IR with delegated authentication 

To create and run a new scan by using the Azure runtime, perform the following steps:

1. Create a user account in the Azure AD tenant where the Power BI tenant is located, and assign the user to the Azure AD role, **Power BI Administrator**. Take note of the username and sign in to change the password.

1. Assign the proper Power BI license to the user.  

1. Go to the instance of Azure Key Vault in the tenant where Microsoft Purview is created.

1. Select **Settings** > **Secrets**, and then select **+ Generate/Import**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/setup-power-bi-scan-catalog-portal/power-bi-key-vault.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the instance of Azure Key Vault.":::
