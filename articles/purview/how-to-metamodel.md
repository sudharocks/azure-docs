# Manage assets with metamodel

[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](includes/feature-in-preview.md)]

Metamodel is a feature in the Microsoft Purview Data Map that gives the technical data in your data map relationships and reference points to make it easier to navigate and understand in the day to day. Like adding streets and cities to a map, the metamodel orients users so they know where they are and can discover the information they need.

This article will get you started in building a metamodel for your Microsoft Purview Data Map.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Create a new, or use an existing Microsoft Purview account. You can [follow our quick-start guide to create one](create-catalog-portal.md).
- Create a new, or use an existing resource group, and place new data sources under it. [Follow this guide to create a new resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal.md).
- [Data Curator role](catalog-permissions.md#roles) on the collection where the data asset is housed and/or the root collection, depending on what you need. See the guide on [managing Microsoft Purview role assignments](catalog-permissions.md#assign-permissions-to-your-users).
    - Create and modify asset types, modify assets - Data Curator on the collection where the data asset is housed. An asset will need to be moved to your collection after creation for you to be able to modify it.
    - Create and modify assets - Data curator on the root collection.
 
>[!NOTE] 
> As this feature is in preview, these permissions are not the final permission structure for metamodel. Updates will continue to be made to this structure.

## Current limitations

>[!NOTE]
> Since this feature is in preview, available abilities are regularly updated.

- When a new asset created, you have to refresh the asset to see relationships
- New assets are created in the root collection, but can be edited afterwards to be moved to a new collection.
- You can't set relationships between two data assets in the Microsoft Purview governance portal
- The related tab only shows a "business lineage" view for business assets, not data assets

## Create and modify asset types

1. To get started, open the data map and select **Asset types**. You’ll see a list of available asset types. [Predefined asset types](#predefined-asset-types) will have unique icons. All custom assets are designated with a puzzle piece icon.

1. To create a new asset type, select **New asset type** and add a name, description, and attributes.

1. To define a relationship between two asset types, select **New relationship type**.  

1. Give the relationship a name and define its reverse direction. Assign it to one or more pairs of assets. Select **Create** to save your new relationship type.

1. As you create more asset types, your canvas may get crowded with asset types. To hide an asset from the canvas, select the eye icon on the asset card.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-metamodel/hide-asset.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an asset card in the asset types canvas, the eye icon in the right corner is highlighted." border="true":::

1. To add an asset type back to the canvas, drag it from the left panel.

## Create and modify assets

1. When you’re ready to begin working with assets, go to the data catalog and select **Business assets**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-metamodel/metamodel-assets-in-catalog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of left menu in the Microsoft Purview governance portal, the data map and business assets buttons highlighted." border="true":::

1. Currently there's no integration with collections, so all assets created via the metamodel canvas will be listed under the data catalog.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-metamodel/assets-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the business assets page." border="true":::

1. To create a new asset, select **New asset**, select the asset type from the drop-down menu, give it a name, description, and complete any required attributes. Select **Create** to save your new asset.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-metamodel/select-new-asset.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the business assets page with the new asset button highlighted." border="true":::

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-metamodel/create-new-asset.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new asset page with a name and description added and the create button highlighted." border="true":::

1. To establish a relationship between two assets, go to the asset detail page and select **Edit > Related**, and the relationship you’d like to populate.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-metamodel/select-edit.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an asset page with the edit button highlighted." border="true":::

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-metamodel/establish-relationships.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the edit asset page with the Related tab open and the relationships highlighted." border="true":::

1. Select the assets or assets you’d like to link from the data catalog and select **OK**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-metamodel/select-related-assets.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the select assets page with two assets selected and the Ok button highlighted." border="true":::

1. Save your changes. You can see the relationships you established in the asset overview.

1. In the **Related** tab of the asset you can also explore a visual representation of related assets.

## Predefined asset types

An asset type is a template for storing a concept that’s important to your organization—anything you might want to represent in your data map alongside your physical metadata. You can create your own, but Purview also comes with a prepackaged set of business asset types you can modify to meet your needs.

| Asset Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Application service| A well-defined software component, especially one that implements a specific business function such as on-boarding a new customer, taking an order, or sending an invoice.  |
| Business process | A set of activities that are performed in coordination in an organizational or technical environment that jointly realizes a business goal. |
| Data Domain | A category of data that is governed or explicitly managed for master data management. |
| Department | An organizational subunit that only has full recognition within the context of that organization. A department wouldn't be regarded as a legal entity in its own right. |
| Line of business | An organization subdivision focused on a single product or family of products. |
| Organization | A collection of people organized together into a community or other social, commercial or political structure. The group has some common purpose or reason for existence that goes beyond the set of people belonging to it and can act as a unit. Organizations are often decomposable into hierarchical structures. |
| Product | Any offered product or service. |
| Project | A specific activity used to control the use of resources and associated costs so they're used appropriately in order to successfully achieve the project's goals, such as building a new capability or improving an existing capability. |
| System | An IT system including hardware and software. |
