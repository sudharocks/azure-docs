# Quickstart: Share and receive data with the Microsoft Purview Data Sharing .NET SDK

[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](includes/feature-in-preview.md)]

In this quickstart, you'll use the .NET SDK provides to share data and receive shares from Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2) or Blob storage accounts. The article includes code snippets that will allow you to share and receive data using Microsoft Purview Data Sharing.

For an overview of how data sharing works, watch this short [demo](https://aka.ms/purview-data-share/overview-demo).

[!INCLUDE [data-share-quickstart-prerequisites](includes/data-share-quickstart-prerequisites.md)]

### Visual Studio

The walkthrough in this article uses Visual Studio 2019. The procedures for Visual Studio 2013, 2015, or 2017 may differ slightly.

### Azure .NET SDK

Download and install [Azure .NET SDK](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/) on your machine.

## Create an application in Azure Active Directory

1. In [Create an Azure Active Directory application](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#register-an-application-with-azure-ad-and-create-a-service-principal), create an application that represents the .NET application you're creating in this tutorial. For the sign-on URL, you can provide a dummy URL as shown in the article (`https://contoso.org/exampleapp`).
1. In [Get values for signing in](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#sign-in-to-the-application), get the **application ID**,**tenant ID**, and **object ID**, and note down these values that you use later in this tutorial.
1. In [Certificates and secrets](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#set-up-authentication), get the **authentication key**, and note down this value that you use later in this tutorial.
1. [assign the application to these roles:](../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#assign-a-role-to-the-application)

  | | Azure Storage Account Roles | Microsoft Purview Collection Roles |
  |:--- |:--- |:--- |
  | **Data Provider** |Owner OR Blob Storage Data Owner|Data Share Contributor|
  | **Data Consumer** |Contributor OR Owner OR Storage Blob Data Contributor OR Blob Storage Data Owner|Data Share Contributor|

## Create a Visual Studio project

Next, create a C# .NET console application in Visual Studio:

1. Launch **Visual Studio**.
2. In the Start window, select **Create a new project** > **Console App (.NET Framework)**. .NET version 4.5.2 or above is required.
3. In **Project name**, enter **PurviewDataSharingQuickStart**.
4. Select **Create** to create the project.

## Install NuGet packages

1. Select **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Console**.
2. In the **Package Manager Console** pane, run the following commands to install packages. For more information, see the [Microsoft.Azure.Analytics.Purview.Share NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Analytics.Purview.Share/1.0.3-beta.20).

    ```powershell
    Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.Purview.Share.ManagementClient
    Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.Management.ResourceManager -IncludePrerelease
    Install-Package Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory
    Install-Package Azure.Analytics.Purview.Share
    Install-Package Azure.Analytics.Purview.Account
    ```

## Create a sent share

The below code will create a data share that you can send to internal or external users.
To use it, be sure to fill out these variables:

- **sentShareName** - a name for your new data share
- **description** - an optional description for your data share
- **collectionName** - the name of the collection where your share will be housed.

```C# Snippet:Azure_Analytics_Purview_Share_Samples_01_Namespaces
using Azure.Core;
using Azure.Identity;

var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
var endPoint = "https://<my-account-name>.purview.azure.com/share";
var sentShareClient = new SentSharesClient(endPoint, credential);
var collectionName = "<name of your collection>";

// Get collection internal reference name
// Collections that are not the root collection have a friendlyName (the name you see in the Microsoft Purview Data Map) and an internal reference name used to access the collection programmatically.
var collectionsResponse = await accountClient.GetCollectionsAsync();

var collectionsResponseDocument = JsonDocument.Parse(collectionsResponse.Content);
var collections = collectionsResponseDocument.RootElement.GetProperty("value");

foreach (var collection in collections.EnumerateArray())
{
    if (String.Equals(collectionName, collection.GetProperty("friendlyName").ToString(), StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    {
        collectionName = collection.GetProperty("name").ToString();
    }
}

// Create sent share
var sentShareName = "sample-Share";
var inPlaceSentShareDto = new
{
    shareKind = "InPlace",
    properties = new
    {
        description = "demo share",
        collection = new
        {
            referenceName = collectionName,
            type = "CollectionReference"
        }
    }
};
var sentShare = await sentShareClient.CreateOrUpdateAsync(sentShareName, RequestContent.Create(inPlaceSentShareDto));
```

## Clean up resources

To clean up the resources created for the quick start, use the following guidelines: 

1. Within [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/), [delete the sent share](how-to-share-data.md#delete-a-sent-share).
1. Also [delete your received share](how-to-receive-share.md#delete-received-share).
1. Once the shares are successfully deleted, delete the target container and folder Microsoft Purview created in your target storage account when you received shared data.
