# ExpressRoute peering locations and connectivity partners 

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [Locations By Provider](expressroute-locations.md)
> * [Providers By Location](expressroute-locations-providers.md)


The tables in this article provide information on ExpressRoute geographical coverage and locations, ExpressRoute connectivity providers, and ExpressRoute System Integrators (SIs).

> [!Note]
> Azure regions and ExpressRoute locations are two distinct and different concepts, understanding the difference between the two is critical to exploring Azure hybrid networking connectivity. 
>

## Azure regions
Azure regions are global datacenters where Azure compute, networking, and storage resources are located. When creating an Azure resource, a customer needs to select a resource location. The resource location determines which Azure datacenter (or availability zone) the resource is created in.

## ExpressRoute locations
ExpressRoute locations (sometimes referred to as peering locations or meet-me-locations) are co-location facilities where Microsoft Enterprise edge (MSEE) devices are located. ExpressRoute locations are the entry point to Microsoft's network – and are globally distributed, providing customers the opportunity to connect to Microsoft's network around the world. These locations are where ExpressRoute partners and ExpressRoute Direct customers issue cross connections to Microsoft's network. In general, the ExpressRoute location doesn't need to match the Azure region. For example, a customer can create an ExpressRoute circuit with the resource location *East US*, in the *Seattle* Peering location.

You'll have access to Azure services across all regions within a geopolitical region if you connected to at least one ExpressRoute location within the geopolitical region.

## <a name="partners"></a>ExpressRoute connectivity providers

The following table shows connectivity locations and the service providers for each location. If you want to view service providers and the locations for which they can provide service, see [Locations by service provider](expressroute-locations.md).

* **Local Azure Regions** refers to the regions that can be accessed by [ExpressRoute Local](expressroute-faqs.md#expressroute-local) at each peering location. **n/a** indicates that ExpressRoute Local isn't available at that peering location.

* **Zone** refers to [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/expressroute/).

* **ER Direct** refers to [ExpressRoute Direct](expressroute-erdirect-about.md) support at each peering location. If you want to view the available bandwidth at a location, see [Determine available bandwidth](expressroute-howto-erdirect.md#resources)

### National cloud environments

Azure national clouds are isolated from each other and from global commercial Azure. ExpressRoute for one Azure cloud can't connect to the Azure regions in the others.

## <a name="c1partners"></a>Connectivity through Exchange providers

If your connectivity provider isn't listed in previous sections, you can still create a connection.

* Check with your connectivity provider to see if they're connected to any of the exchanges in the table above. You can check the following links to gather more information about services offered by exchange providers. Several connectivity providers are already connected to Ethernet exchanges.
  * [Cologix](https://www.cologix.com/)
  * [CoreSite](https://www.coresite.com/)
  * [DE-CIX](https://www.de-cix.net/en/de-cix-service-world/cloud-exchange)
  * [Equinix Cloud Exchange](https://www.equinix.com/resources/videos/cloud-exchange-overview)
  * [InterXion](https://www.interxion.com/)
  * [NextDC](https://www.nextdc.com/)
  * [Megaport](https://www.megaport.com/services/microsoft-expressroute/)
  * [PacketFabric](https://www.packetfabric.com/cloud-connectivity/microsoft-azure)
  * [Teraco](https://www.teraco.co.za/platform-teraco/africa-cloud-exchange/)
  
* Have your connectivity provider extend your network to the peering location of choice.
  * Ensure that your connectivity provider extends your connectivity in a highly available manner so that there are no single points of failure.
* Order an ExpressRoute circuit with the exchange as your connectivity provider to connect to Microsoft.
  * Follow steps in [Create an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-classic.md) to set up connectivity.

## Connectivity through satellite operators
If you're remote and don't have fiber connectivity or want to explore other connectivity options, you can check the following satellite operators. 

* Intelsat
* [SES](https://www.ses.com/networks/signature-solutions/signature-cloud/ses-and-azure-expressroute)
