# How to: Write a TokenProvider with an Azure Function

> [!NOTE]
> This preview version is provided without a service-level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.

In the [Fluid Framework](https://fluidframework.com/), TokenProviders are responsible for creating and signing tokens that the `@fluidframework/azure-client` uses to make requests to the Azure Fluid Relay service. The Fluid Framework provides a simple, insecure TokenProvider for development purposes, aptly named **InsecureTokenProvider**. Each Fluid service must implement a custom TokenProvider based on the particular service's authentication and security considerations.

Each Azure Fluid Relay resource you create is assigned a **tenant ID** and its own unique **tenant secret key**. The secret key is a **shared secret**. Your app/service knows it, and the Azure Fluid Relay service knows it. TokenProviders must know the secret key to sign requests, but the secret key can't be included in client code.

## Implement an Azure Function to sign tokens

One option for building a secure token provider is to create HTTPS endpoint and create a TokenProvider implementation that makes authenticated HTTPS requests to that endpoint to retrieve tokens. This path enables you to store the *tenant secret key* in a secure location, such as [Azure Key Vault](../../key-vault/general/overview.md).

The complete solution has two pieces:

1. An HTTPS endpoint that accepts requests and returns Azure Fluid Relay tokens.
1. An ITokenProvider implementation that accepts a URL to an endpoint, then makes requests to that endpoint to retrieve tokens.

### Create an endpoint for your TokenProvider using Azure Functions

Using [Azure Functions](../../azure-functions/functions-overview.md) is a fast way to create such an HTTPS endpoint. The example below implements that pattern in a class called [AzureFunctionTokenProvider](https://fluidframework.com/docs/apis/azure-client/azurefunctiontokenprovider-class). It accepts the URL to your Azure Function, `userId` and`userName`. 

This example demonstrates how to create your own **HTTPTrigger Azure Function** that fetches the token by passing in your tenant key.

```typescript
import { AzureFunction, Context, HttpRequest } from "@azure/functions";
import { ScopeType } from "@fluidframework/azure-client";
import { generateToken } from "@fluidframework/azure-service-utils";

// NOTE: retrieve the key from a secure location.
const key = "myTenantKey";

const httpTrigger: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context, req: HttpRequest): Promise<void> {
    // tenantId, documentId, userId and userName are required parameters
    const tenantId = (req.query.tenantId || (req.body && req.body.tenantId)) as string;
    const documentId = (req.query.documentId || (req.body && req.body.documentId)) as string | undefined;
    const userId = (req.query.userId || (req.body && req.body.userId)) as string;
    const userName = (req.query.userName || (req.body && req.body.userName)) as string;
    const scopes = (req.query.scopes || (req.body && req.body.scopes)) as ScopeType[];

    if (!tenantId) {
        context.res = {
            status: 400,
            body: "No tenantId provided in query params",
        };
        return;
    }

    if (!key) {
        context.res = {
            status: 404,
            body: `No key found for the provided tenantId: ${tenantId}`,
        };
        return;
    }

    let user = { name: userName, id: userId };

    // Will generate the token and returned by an ITokenProvider implementation to use with the AzureClient.
    const token = generateToken(
        tenantId,
        documentId,
        key,
        scopes ?? [ScopeType.DocRead, ScopeType.DocWrite, ScopeType.SummaryWrite],
        user
    );

    context.res = {
        status: 200,
        body: token
    };
};

export default httpTrigger;
```

The `generateToken` function, found in the `@fluidframework/azure-service-utils` package, generates a token for the given user that is signed using the tenant's secret key. This method enables the token to be returned to the client without exposing the secret. Instead, the token is generated server-side using the secret to provide scoped access to the given document. The example ITokenProvider below makes HTTP requests to this Azure Function to retrieve the tokens.

### Deploy the Azure Function

Azure Functions can be deployed in several ways. For more information, see the **Deploy** section of the [Azure Functions documentation](../../azure-functions/functions-continuous-deployment.md) for more information about deploying Azure Functions.

### Implement the TokenProvider

TokenProviders can be implemented in many ways, but must implement two separate API calls: `fetchOrdererToken` and `fetchStorageToken`. These APIs are responsible for fetching tokens for the Fluid orderer and storage services respectively. Both functions return `TokenResponse` objects representing the token value. The Fluid Framework runtime calls these two APIs as needed to retrieve tokens. Note that while your application code is using only one service endpoint to establish connectivity with the Azure Fluid Relay service, the azure-client internally in conjunction with the service translate that one endpoint to an orderer and storage endpoint pair. Those two endpoints are used from that point on for that session which is why you need to implement the two separate functions for fetching tokens, one for each.

To ensure that the tenant secret key is kept secure, it's stored in a secure backend location and is only accessible from within the Azure Function. To retrieve tokens, you need to make a `GET` or `POST` request to your deployed Azure Function, providing the `tenantID` and `documentId`, and `userID`/`userName`. The Azure Function is responsible for the mapping between the tenant ID and a tenant key secret to appropriately generate and sign the token.

This example implementation below uses the [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) library to make HTTP requests. You can use other libraries or approaches to making an HTTP request from server code.

```typescript
import { ITokenProvider, ITokenResponse } from "@fluidframework/routerlicious-driver";
import axios from "axios";
import { AzureMember } from "./interfaces";

/**
 * Token Provider implementation for connecting to an Azure Function endpoint for
 * Azure Fluid Relay token resolution.
 */
export class AzureFunctionTokenProvider implements ITokenProvider {
    /**
     * Creates a new instance using configuration parameters.
     * @param azFunctionUrl - URL to Azure Function endpoint
     * @param user - User object
     */
    constructor(
        private readonly azFunctionUrl: string,
        private readonly user?: Pick<AzureMember, "userId" | "userName" | "additionalDetails">,
    ) { }

    public async fetchOrdererToken(tenantId: string, documentId?: string): Promise<ITokenResponse> {
        return {
            jwt: await this.getToken(tenantId, documentId),
        };
    }

    public async fetchStorageToken(tenantId: string, documentId: string): Promise<ITokenResponse> {
        return {
            jwt: await this.getToken(tenantId, documentId),
        };
    }

    private async getToken(tenantId: string, documentId: string | undefined): Promise<string> {
        const response = await axios.get(this.azFunctionUrl, {
            params: {
                tenantId,
                documentId,
                userId: this.user?.userId,
                userName: this.user?.userName,
                additionalDetails: this.user?.additionalDetails,
            },
        });
        return response.data as string;
    }
}
```
