# Back up SAP HANA System Replication databases on Azure VMs (preview)

SAP HANA databases are critical workloads that require a low recovery-point objective (RPO) and long-term retention. This article describes how you can back up SAP HANA databases that are running on Azure virtual machines (VMs) to an Azure Backup Recovery Services vault by using [Azure Backup](backup-overview.md).

>[!Note]
> For more information about the supported configurations and scenarios, see [SAP HANA backup support matrix](sap-hana-backup-support-matrix.md).

## Prerequisites

- Identify/create a Recovery Services vault in the same region and subscription as the two VMs/nodes of the HANA System Replication (HSR) database.
- Allow connectivity from each of the VMs/nodes to the internet for communication with Azure. 

>[!Important]
>Ensure that the combined length of the SAP HANA Server VM name and the resource group name doesn't exceed 84 characters for Azure Resource Manager VMs and 77 characters for classic VMs. This limitation is because some characters are reserved by the service.


[!INCLUDE [Create a Recovery Services vault](../../includes/backup-create-rs-vault.md)]

## Discover the databases

To discover the HSR database, follow these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, go to **Backup center**, and then select **+ Backup**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-hana-database-with-hana-system-replication-backup/initiate-database-discovery.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to start database discovery.":::

1. Select **SAP HANA in Azure VM** as the data source type, select the Recovery Services vault to use for the backup, and then select **Continue**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-hana-database-with-hana-system-replication-backup/configure-backup.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to configure a database backup.":::

1. Select **Start Discovery** to initiate the discovery of unprotected Linux VMs in the vault region.
   - After discovery, unprotected VMs appear in the portal, listed by name and resource group.
   - If a VM isn't listed as expected, check to see whether it's already backed up in a vault.
   - Multiple VMs can have the same name, but they must belong to different resource groups.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-hana-database-with-hana-system-replication-backup/discover-hana-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to discover a HANA database.":::

1. On the **Select Virtual Machines** pane, at the bottom, select the **this** link in **Run this script on the SAP HANA VMs to provide these permissions to Azure Backup service**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-hana-database-with-hana-system-replication-backup/download-script.png" alt-text="Screenshot that highlights the link for downloading the script.":::

1. Run the script on each VM that hosts SAP HANA databases that you want to back up.

1. On the **Select Virtual Machines** pane, after you run the script on the VMs, select the VMs, and then select **Discover DBs**.

   Azure Backup discovers all SAP HANA databases on the VM. During discovery, Azure Backup registers the VM with the vault and installs an extension on the VM. It doesn't install any agent on the database.

   To view the details about all the databases of each discovered VM, select **View details** under the **Step 1: Discover DBs in VMs section**.

## Run the preregistration script

When a failover occurs, the users are replicated to the new primary, but *hdbuserstore* isn't replicated. So, you need to create the same key in all nodes of the HSR setup, which allows the Azure Backup service to connect to any new primary node automatically, without any manual intervention. 

1. Create a custom backup user in the HANA system with the following roles and permissions:

   | Role | Permission | Description |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | MDC | Database Admin and Backup Admin (HANA 2.0 SPS05 and later) | Creates new databases during restore. |
   | SDC | Backup Admin | Reads the backup catalog. |
   | SAP_INTERNAL_HANA_SUPPORT |      | Accesses a few private tables. <br><br> Required only for single container database (SDC) and multiple container database (MDC) versions earlier than HANA 2.0 SPS04 Rev 46. It isn't required for HANA 2.0 SPS04 Rev 46 versions and later, because we receive the required information from public tables now after the fix from HANA team. |

1. Add the key to *hdbuserstore* for your custom backup user that enables the HANA backup plug-in to manage all operations (database queries, restore operations, configuring, and running backup). 

1. Pass the custom backup user key to the script as a parameter: 

   `-bk CUSTOM_BACKUP_KEY_NAME` or `-backup-key CUSTOM_BACKUP_KEY_NAME`
   
   If the password of this custom backup key expires, it could lead to the backup and restore operations failure.

1. Create the same customer backup user (with the same password) and key (in *hdbuserstore*) on both VMs/nodes.

1. Run the SAP HANA backup configuration script (preregistration script) in the VMs where HANA is installed as the root user. This script sets up the HANA system for backup. For more information about the script actions, see the [What the preregistration script does](tutorial-backup-sap-hana-db.md#what-the-pre-registration-script-does) section.

   There's no HANA-generated unique ID for an HSR setup. So, you need to provide a unique ID that helps the backup service to group all nodes of an HSR as a single data source. 
   
1. Provide a unique HSR ID as input to the script: 

   `-hn HSR_UNIQUE_VALUE` or `--hsr-unique-value HSR_Unique_Value`. 
   
   You must provide the same HSR ID on both VMs/nodes. This ID must be unique within a vault. It should be an alphanumeric value containing at least one digit, one lowercase letter, and one uppercase character, and it should contain from 6 to 35 characters.

1. While you're running the preregistration script on the secondary node, you must specify the SDC/MDC port as input. This is because SQL commands to identify the SDC/MDC setup can't be run on the secondary node. You must provide the port number as a parameter, as shown here: 

   `-p PORT_NUMBER` or `–port_number PORT_NUMBER`.

   - For MDC, use the format `3<instancenumber>13`.
   - For SDC, use the format `3<instancenumber>15`.

1. If your HANA setup uses private endpoints, run the preregistration script with the `-sn` or `--skip-network-checks` parameter. Ater the preregistration script has run successfully, proceed to the next steps.
   
To set up the database for backup, see the [prerequisites](tutorial-backup-sap-hana-db.md#prerequisites) and the [What the preregistration script does](tutorial-backup-sap-hana-db.md#what-the-pre-registration-script-does) sections.

## Configure backup

To enable the backup, follow these steps:

1. On the **Backup Goal** pane, in **Step 2**, select **Configure Backup**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-hana-database-with-hana-system-replication-backup/configure-database-backup.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the 'Configure Backup' button.":::

1. On the **Select items to back up** pane, select all the databases you want to protect, and then select **OK**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-hana-database-with-hana-system-replication-backup/select-virtual-machines-for-protection.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a list of virtual machines available to be backed up.":::

1. In the **Backup policy** dropdown list, select the policy you want to use, and then select **Add**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-hana-database-with-hana-system-replication-backup/create-backup-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to select and add a backup policy.":::

1. After you've created the policy, on the **Backup** pane, select **Enable backup**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-hana-database-with-hana-system-replication-backup/enable-backup.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the 'Enable backup' button for backing up the database.":::

1. To track the backup configuration progress, go to **Notifications** in the Azure portal.

## Create a backup policy

A backup policy defines the backup schedules and the backup retention duration.

>[!Note]
>-  A policy is created at the vault level.
>-  Multiple vaults can use the same backup policy, but you must apply the backup policy to each vault.
>- Azure Backup doesn’t automatically adjust for daylight saving time changes when you're backing up an SAP HANA database that's running in an Azure VM. Modify the policy manually as needed.

To configure the policy settings, follow these steps:

1. On the **Backup policy** pane, in the **Policy name** box, enter a name for the new policy.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-hana-database-with-hana-system-replication-backup/add-policy-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the 'Backup policy' pane for entering a policy name.":::

1. Under **Full Backup**, for **Backup Frequency**, select **Daily** or **Weekly**.

   - **Daily**: Select the hour and time zone in which the backup job must begin.
     - You must run a full backup. You can't turn off this option.
     - Select **Full Backup** to view the policy.
     - You can't create differential backups for daily full backups.

   - **Weekly**: Select the day of the week, hour, and time zone in which the backup job must run.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-hana-database-with-hana-system-replication-backup/select-backup-frequency.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to configure the backup frequency.":::

1. On the **Full Backup Policy** pane, under **Retention Range**, configure the retention settings for the full backup.

   - By default, all options are selected. Clear any retention range limits that you don't want to use, and then set them as required.
   - The minimum retention period for any type of backup (full/differential/log) is 7 days.
   - Recovery points are tagged for retention based on their retention range. For example, if you select a daily full backup, only one full backup is triggered each day.
   - The backup data for a specific day is tagged and retained based on the weekly retention range and settings.

1. Select **OK** to save the policy settings.

1. Select **Differential Backup** to add a differential policy.

1. In **Differential Backup policy**, select **Enable** to open the frequency and retention controls.

   - You can trigger a maximum of one differential backup per day.
   - You can retain differential backups for a maximum of 180 days. If you need a longer retention, you must use full backups.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-hana-database-with-hana-system-replication-backup/configure-differential-backup-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to configure a differential backup policy for a database.":::

   >[!Note]
   >You can choose either a differential or an incremental backup as a daily backup at a specified time.

1. On the **Incremental Backup Policy** pane, select **Enable** to open the frequency and retention controls.

   - You can trigger a maximum of one incremental backup per day.
   - You can retain incremental backups for a maximum of 180 days. If you need a longer retention, you must use full backups.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/sap-hana-database-with-hana-system-replication-backup/enable-incremental-backup-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to enable an incremental backup policy.":::

1. Select **OK** to save the policy and return to the main **Backup policy** menu.

1. Select **Log Backup** to add a transactional log backup policy.

   - In **Log Backup**, select **Enable**.

     You can't disable this option, because SAP HANA manages all log backups.

   - Set the frequency and retention controls.

   >[!Note]
   >Streaming of log backups begins only after a successful full backup is complete.

1. Select **OK** to save the policy and return to the main **Backup policy** menu.
1. After  the backup policy configuration is complete, select **OK**.

   All log backups are chained to the previous full backup to form a recovery chain. A full backup is retained until the expiration of the last log backup. So, the full backup is retained for an extra period to ensure that all logs can be recovered. 

   For example, let's say that you have a weekly full backup, daily differential, and *2 hour* logs. All of them are retained for *30 days*. But the weekly full backup is deleted only after the next full backup is available (that is, after *30 + 7 days*).

   If a weekly full backup happens on November 16, it should be retained, as per the retention policy, until December 16. The last log backup for this full backup happens before the next scheduled full backup, on November 22. Until this log becomes available on December 22, the November 16 full backup isn't deleted. So, the November 16 full backup is retained until December 22.

## Run an on-demand backup

Backups run in accordance with the policy schedule. Learn how to [run an on-demand backup](sap-hana-database-manage.md#run-on-demand-backups).

## Run SAP HANA native clients backup on a database with Azure Backup

You can run an on-demand backup using SAP HANA native clients to local file-system instead of Backint. Learn more how to [manage operations using SAP native clients](sap-hana-database-manage.md#manage-operations-using-sap-hana-native-clients).
