# Manage individual sensors

This article describes how to manage individual sensors, such as managing activation files, certificates, backups, and more.

You can also perform some management tasks for multiple sensors simultaneously from the Azure portal or an on-premises management console. For more information, see [Next steps](#next-steps).

[!INCLUDE [caution do not use manual configurations](includes/caution-manual-configurations.md)]

## View overall sensor status

When you sign into your sensor, the first page shown is the **Overview** page.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/screenshot-of-overview-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the overview page." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/screenshot-of-overview-page.png":::

The **Overview** page shows the following widgets:

| Name | Description |
|--|--|
| **General Settings** | Displays a list of the sensor's basic configuration settings and [connectivity status](#validate-connectivity-status). |
| **Traffic Monitoring** | Displays a graph detailing traffic in the sensor. The graph shows traffic as units of Mbps per hour on the day of viewing. |
| **Top 5 OT Protocols** | Displays a bar graph that details the top five most used OT protocols. The bar graph also provides the number of devices that are using each of those protocols. |
| **Traffic By Port** | Displays a pie chart showing the types of ports in your network, with the amount of traffic detected in each type of port. |
| **Top open alerts** | Displays a table listing any currently open alerts with high severity levels, including critical details about each alert. |

Select the link in each widget to drill down for more information in your sensor.

### Validate connectivity status

Verify that your sensor is successfully connected to the Azure portal directly from the sensor's **Overview** page. 

If there are any connection issues, a disconnection message is shown in the **General Settings** area on the **Overview** page, and a **Service connection error** warning appears at the top of the page in the :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/bell-icon.png" border="false"::: **System Messages** area. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/connectivity-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a sensor page showing the connectivity status as disconnected." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/connectivity-status.png":::

1. Find more information about the issue by hovering over the :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/information-icon.png" border="false"::: information icon. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/connectivity-message.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a connectivity error message." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/connectivity-message.png":::

1. Take action by selecting the **Learn more** option under :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/bell-icon.png" border="false"::: **System Messages**. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/system-messages.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the system messages pane." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/system-messages.png":::

## Manage sensor activation files

Your sensor was onboarded with Microsoft Defender for IoT from the Azure portal. Each sensor was onboarded as either a locally connected sensor or a cloud-connected sensor.

A unique activation file is uploaded to each sensor that you deploy. For more information about when and how to use a new file, see [Upload new activation files](#upload-new-activation-files). If you can't upload the file, see [Troubleshoot activation file upload](#troubleshoot-activation-file-upload).

### About activation files for locally connected sensors

Locally connected sensors are associated with an Azure subscription. The activation file for your locally connected sensors contains an expiration date. One month before this date, a warning message appears in the System Messages window in the top-right corner of the console. The warning remains until after you've updated the activation file.

You can continue to work with Defender for IoT features even if the activation file has expired.
You can continue to work with Defender for IoT features even if the activation file has expired.

### About activation files for cloud-connected sensors

Sensors that are cloud connected aren't limited by time periods for their activation file. The activation file for cloud-connected sensors is used to ensure the connection to Defender for IoT.

### Upload new activation files

You might need to upload a new activation file for an onboarded sensor when:

- An activation file expires on a locally connected sensor.

- You want to work in a different sensor management mode.

- For sensors connected via an IoT Hub ([legacy](architecture-connections.md)), you want to assign a new Defender for IoT hub to a cloud-connected sensor.

**To add a new activation file:**

1. Go to the Azure portal for Defender for IoT.
1. Use the search bar to find the sensor you need.  

1. Select the three dots (...) on the row and select **Delete sensor**.

1. Onboard the sensor again by selecting **Getting Started**>  **Set up OT/ICS Security** > **Register this sensor with Microsoft Defender for IoT**.

1. Go to the **Sites and sensors** page.

1. Use the search bar to find the sensor you just added, and select it.
1. Select the three dots (...) on the row and select **Download activation file**.

    [!INCLUDE [root-of-trust](includes/root-of-trust.md)]

1. Save the file.

1. Sign in to the Defender for IoT sensor console.

1. Select **System Settings** > **Sensor management** > **Subscription & Activation Mode**.

1. Select **Upload** and select the file that you saved.

1. Select **Activate**.

### Troubleshoot activation file upload

You'll receive an error message if the activation file couldn't be uploaded. The following events might have occurred:

- **For locally connected sensors**: The activation file isn't valid. If the file isn't valid, go to [Defender for IoT in the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_IoT_Defender/IoTDefenderDashboard/Getting_Started). On the **Sensor Management** page, select the sensor with the invalid file, and download a new activation file.

- **For cloud-connected sensors**: The sensor can't connect to the internet. Check the sensor's network configuration. If your sensor needs to connect through a web proxy to access the internet, verify that your proxy server is configured correctly on the **Sensor Network Configuration** screen. Verify that the required endpoints are allowed in the firewall and/or proxy.

    For OT sensors version 22.x, download the list of required endpoints from the  **Sites and sensors** page on the Azure portal. Select an OT sensor with a supported software version, or a site with one or more supported sensors. And then select **More actions** > **Download endpoint details**. For sensors with earlier versions, see [Sensor access to Azure portal](how-to-set-up-your-network.md#sensor-access-to-azure-portal).

- **For cloud-connected sensors**: The activation file is valid but Defender for IoT rejected it. If you can't resolve this problem, you can download another activation from the **Sites and Sensors** page in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_IoT_Defender/IoTDefenderDashboard/Getting_Started). If this doesn't work, contact Microsoft Support.

## Manage certificates

Following sensor installation, a local self-signed certificate is generated and used to access the sensor web application. When logging in to the sensor for the first time, Administrator users are prompted to provide an SSL/TLS certificate.

Sensor Administrators may be required to update certificates that were uploaded after initial login. This may happen, for example,  if a certificate expired.

**To update a certificate:**

1. Select **System Settings** and then select **Basic**.

1. Select **SSL/TLS Certificate.**

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/certificate-upload.png" alt-text="Upload a certificate":::

1. In the SSL/TLS Certificates dialog box, delete the existing certificate and add a new one.

    - Add a certificate name.
    - Upload a CRT file and key file.
    - Upload a PEM file if necessary.

If the upload fails, contact your security or IT administrator, or review the information in [Deploy SSL/TLS certificates on OT appliances](how-to-deploy-certificates.md).

**To change the certificate validation setting:**

1. Enable or disable the **Enable Certificate Validation** toggle. If the option is enabled and validation fails, communication between relevant components is halted, and a validation error is presented in the console. If disabled, certificate validation is not carried out. See [Verify CRL server access](how-to-deploy-certificates.md#verify-crl-server-access) for more information.

1. Select **Save**.

For more information about first-time certificate upload, see,
[First-time sign-in and activation checklist](how-to-activate-and-set-up-your-sensor.md#first-time-sign-in-and-activation-checklist)

## Connect a sensor to the management console

This section describes how to ensure connection between the sensor and the on-premises management console. You need to do this if you're working in an air-gapped network and want to send device and alert information to the management console from the sensor. This connection also allows the management console to push system settings to the sensor and perform other management tasks on the sensor.

**To connect:**

1. Sign in to the on-premises management console.

2. Select **System Settings**.

3. In the **Sensor Setup – Connection String** section, copy the automatically generated connection string.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/connection-string-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Connection string screen.":::

4. Sign in to the sensor console.

You can automatically transfer this file to the internal network.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The backup and restore procedure can be performed between the same versions only.
> - In some architectures, the backup is disabled. You can enable it in the `/var/cyberx/properties/backup.properties` file.

When you control a sensor by using the on-premises management console, you can use the sensor's backup schedule to collect these backups and store them on the management console or on an external backup server. For more information, see [Define sensor backup schedules](how-to-manage-sensors-from-the-on-premises-management-console.md#define-sensor-backup-schedules).

**What is backed up**: Configurations and data.

**What is not backed up**: PCAP files and logs. You can manually back up and restore PCAPs and logs. For more information, see [Upload and play PCAP files](#upload-and-play-pcap-files).

Sensor backup files are automatically named through the following format: `<sensor name>-backup-version-<version>-<date>.tar`. An example is `Sensor_1-backup-version-2.6.0.102-2019-06-24_09:24:55.tar`.

**To configure backup:**

- Sign in to an administrative account and enter `cyberx-xsense-system-backup`.

**To restore the latest backup file:**

- Sign in to an administrative account and enter `cyberx-xsense-system-restore`.

**To save the backup to an external SMB server:**

1. Create a shared folder in the external SMB server.

    Get the folder path, username, and password required to access the SMB server.

2. In the sensor, make a directory for the backups:

    - `sudo mkdir /<backup_folder_name_on_cyberx_server>`

    - `sudo chmod 777 /<backup_folder_name_on_cyberx_server>/`

3. Edit `fstab`:

    - `sudo nano /etc/fstab`

    - `add - //<server_IP>/<folder_path> /<backup_folder_name_on_cyberx_server> cifsrw,credentials=/etc/samba/user,vers=X.X,uid=cyberx,gid=cyberx,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0`

4. Edit and create credentials to share for the SMB server:

    `sudo nano /etc/samba/user`

5. Add:

    - `username=&gt:user name&lt:`

    - `password=<password>`

6. Mount the directory:

    `sudo mount -a`

7. Configure a backup directory to the shared folder on the Defender for IoT sensor:  

    - `sudo nano /var/cyberx/properties/backup.properties`

    - `set backup_directory_path to <backup_folder_name_on_cyberx_server>`

1. For a locally managed sensor, version 22.1.3 or higher, continue with [Upload a diagnostics log for support](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#upload-a-diagnostics-log-for-support).

## Retrieve forensics data stored on the sensor

Use Defender for IoT data mining reports on an OT network sensor to retrieve forensic data from that sensor’s storage. The following types of forensic data are stored locally on OT sensors, for devices detected by that sensor:

- Device data
- Alert data
- Alert PCAP files
- Event timeline data
- Log files

Each type of data has a different retention period and maximum capacity. For more information see [Create data mining queries](how-to-create-data-mining-queries.md).

## Clearing sensor data

In cases where the sensor needs to be relocated or erased, the sensor can be reset.

Clearing data deletes all detected or learned data on the sensor. After clearing data on a cloud connected sensor, cloud inventory will be updated accordingly. Additionally, some actions on the corresponding cloud alerts such as downloading PCAPs or learning alerts will not be supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Network settings such as IP/DNS/GATEWAY will not be changed by clearing system data.

**To clear system data**:

1. Sign in to the sensor as the *cyberx* user.

1. Select **Support** > **Clear data**.

1. In the confirmation dialog box, select **Yes** to confirm that you do want to clear all data from the sensor and reset it. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/clear-system-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of clearing system data on the support page in the sensor console." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-individual-sensors/clear-system-data.png":::
