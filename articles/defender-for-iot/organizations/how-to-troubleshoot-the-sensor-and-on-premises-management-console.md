# Troubleshoot the sensor and on-premises management console

This article describes basic troubleshooting tools for the sensor and the on-premises management console. In addition to the items described here, you can check the health of your system in the following ways:

- **Alerts**: An alert is created when the sensor interface that monitors the traffic is down.
- **SNMP**: Sensor health is monitored through SNMP. Microsoft Defender for IoT responds to SNMP queries sent from an authorized monitoring server.
- **System notifications**: When a management console controls the sensor, you can forward alerts about failed sensor backups and disconnected sensors.

## Check system health

Check your system health from the sensor or on-premises management console.

**To access the system health tool**:

1. Sign in to the sensor or on-premises management console with the *support* user credentials.

1. Select **System Statistics** from the **System Settings** window.

1. System health data appears. Select an item on the left to view more details in the box. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-install-components/system-health-check-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the system health check.":::

System health checks include the following:

|Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Sanity**     |         |
|- Appliance     | Runs the appliance sanity check. You can perform the same check by using the CLI command `system-sanity`.        |
|- Version     | Displays the appliance version.        |
|- Network Properties     | Displays the sensor network parameters.        |
|**Redis**     |         |
|- Memory     |   Provides the overall picture of memory usage, such as how much memory was used and how much remained.      |
|- Longest Key     | Displays the longest keys that might cause extensive memory usage.        |
|**System**     |         |
|- Core Log     | Provides the last 500 rows of the core log, so that you can view the recent log rows without exporting the entire system log.        |
|- Task Manager     |  Translates the tasks that appear in the table of processes to the following layers: <br><br>  - Persistent layer (Redis)<br>  - Cache layer (SQL) |
|- Network Statistics     | Displays your network statistics.        |
|- TOP     |    Shows the table of processes. It's a Linux command that provides a dynamic real-time view of the running system.     |
|- Backup Memory Check     | Provides the status of the backup memory, checking the following:<br><br> - The location of the backup folder<br>  - The size of the backup folder<br>  - The limitations of the backup folder<br>  - When the last backup happened<br>  - How much space there are for the extra backup files        |
|- ifconfig     | Displays the parameters for the appliance's physical interfaces.        |
|- CyberX nload     | Displays network traffic and bandwidth by using the six-second tests.        |
|- Errors from Core, log     |  Displays errors from the core log file.       |

### Check system health by using the CLI

Verify that the system is up and running prior to testing the system's sanity.

For more information, see [CLI command reference from OT network sensors](cli-ot-sensor.md).

**To test the system's sanity**:

1. Connect to the CLI with the Linux terminal (for example, PuTTY) and the user *support*.

1. Enter `system sanity`.

1. Check that all the services are green (running).

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-install-components/support-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows running services.":::

1. Verify that **System is UP! (prod)** appears at the bottom.

Verify that the correct version is used:

**To check the system's version**:

1. Connect to the CLI with the Linux terminal (for example, PuTTY) and the user *support*.

1. Enter `system version`.

1. Check that the correct version appears.

Verify that all the input interfaces configured during the installation process are running:

**To validate the system's network status**:

1. Connect to the CLI with the Linux terminal (for example, PuTTY) and the *support* user.

1. Enter `network list` (the equivalent of the Linux command `ifconfig`).

1. Validate that the required input interfaces appear. For example, if two quad Copper NICs are installed, there should be 10 interfaces in the list.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-install-components/interface-list-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the list of interfaces.":::

Verify that you can access the console web GUI:

**To check that management has access to the UI**:

1. Connect a laptop with an Ethernet cable to the management port (**Gb1**).

1. Define the laptop NIC address to be in the same range as the appliance.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-install-components/access-to-ui.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows management access to the UI." border="false":::

1. Ping the appliance's IP address from the laptop to verify connectivity (default: 10.100.10.1).

1. Open the Chrome browser in the laptop and enter the appliance's IP address.

1. In the **Your connection is not private** window, select **Advanced** and proceed.

1. The test is successful when the Defender for IoT sign-in screen appears.

## Troubleshoot sensors


### You can't connect by using a web interface

1. Verify that the computer that you're trying to connect is on the same network as the appliance.

1. Verify that the GUI network is connected to the management port.

1. Ping the appliance's IP address. If there's no ping:

   1. Connect a monitor and a keyboard to the appliance.

   1. Use the *support* user and password to sign in.

   1. Use the command `network list` to see the current IP address.

1. If the network parameters are misconfigured, use the following procedure to change them:

   1. Use the command `network edit-settings`.

   1. To change the management network IP address, select **Y**.

   1. To change the subnet mask, select **Y**.

   1. To change the DNS, select **Y**.

   1. To change the default gateway IP address, select **Y**.

   1. For the input interface change (sensor only), select **N**.

   1. To apply the settings, select **Y**.

1. After restart, connect with the *support* user credentials and use the `network list` command to verify that the parameters were changed.

1. Try to ping and connect from the GUI again.

### The appliance isn't responding

1. Connect a monitor and keyboard to the appliance, or use PuTTY to connect remotely to the CLI.

1. Use the *support* user credentials to sign in.

1. Use the `system sanity` command and check that all processes are running. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-install-components/system-sanity-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the system sanity command.":::

For any other issues, contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/supportforbusiness/productselection?sapId=82c88f35-1b8e-f274-ec11-c6efdd6dd099).


### Investigate password failure at initial sign-in

When signing into a pre-configured sensor for the first time, you'll need to perform password recovery as follows:

1. On the Defender for IoT sign in screen, select  **Password recovery**. The **Password recovery** screen opens.

1. Select either **CyberX** or **Support**, and copy the unique identifier.

1. Navigate to the Azure portal and select **Sites and Sensors**.

1. Select the **More Actions** drop down menu and select **Recover on-premises management console password**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-and-manage-users/recover-password.png" alt-text=" Screenshot of the recover on-premises management console password option.":::

1. Enter the unique identifier that you received on the **Password recovery** screen and select **Recover**. The `password_recovery.zip` file is downloaded. Don't extract or modify the zip file.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-and-manage-users/enter-identifier.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Recover dialog box.":::

1. On the **Password recovery** screen, select **Upload**. **The Upload Password Recovery File** window will open.

1. Select **Browse** to locate your `password_recovery.zip` file, or drag the `password_recovery.zip` to the window.

1. Select **Next**, and your user, and system-generated password for your management console will then appear.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you sign in to a sensor or on-premises management console for the first time, it's linked to your Azure subscription, which you'll need if you need to recover the password for the *cyberx*, or *support* user. For more information, see the relevant procedure for [sensors](manage-users-sensor.md#recover-privileged-access-to-a-sensor) or an [on-premises management console](manage-users-on-premises-management-console.md#recover-privileged-access-to-an-on-premises-management-console).

### Investigate a lack of traffic

An indicator appears at the top of the console when the sensor recognizes that there's no traffic on one of the configured ports. This indicator is visible to all users. When this message appears, you can investigate where there's no traffic. Make sure the span cable is connected and there was no change in the span architecture.


### Check system performance

When a new sensor is deployed or a sensor is working slowly or not showing any alerts, you can check system performance.

1. In the Defender for IoT dashboard > **Overview**, make sure that `PPS > 0`.
1. In *Devices** check that devices are being discovered.
1. In **Data Mining**, generate a report.
1. In **Trends & Statistics** window, create a dashboard.
1. In **Alerts**, check that the alert was created.


### Investigate a lack of expected alerts

If the **Alerts** window doesn't show an alert that you expected, verify the following:

1. Check if the same alert already appears in the **Alerts** window as a reaction to a different security instance. If yes, and this alert hasn't been handled yet, the sensor console does not show a new alert.
1. Make sure you did not exclude this alert by using the **Alert Exclusion** rules in the management console.

### Investigate dashboard that shows no data

When the dashboards in the **Trends & Statistics** window show no data, do the following:
1. [Check system performance](#check-system-performance).
1. Make sure the time and region settings are properly configured and not set to a future time.

### Investigate a device map that shows only broadcasting devices

When devices shown on the device map appear not connected to each other, something might be wrong with the SPAN port configuration. That is, you might be seeing only broadcasting devices and no unicast traffic.

1. Validate that you're only seeing the broadcast traffic. To do this, in **Data Mining**, select **Create report**. In **Create new report**,specify the report fields. In **Choose Category**, choose **Select all**.
1. Save the report, and review it to see if only broadcast and multicast traffic (and no unicast traffic) appears. If so, asking networking to fix the SPAN port configuration so that you can see the unicast traffic as well. Alternately, you can record a PCAP directly from the switch, or connect a laptop by using Wireshark.

### Connect the sensor to NTP

You can configure a standalone sensor and a management console, with the sensors related to it, to connect to NTP.

To connect a standalone sensor to NTP:

- [See the CLI documentation](./references-work-with-defender-for-iot-cli-commands.md).

To connect a sensor controlled by the management console to NTP:

- The connection to NTP is configured on the management console. All the sensors that the management console controls get the NTP connection automatically.

### Investigate when devices aren't shown on the map, or you have multiple internet-related alerts

Sometimes ICS devices are configured with external IP addresses. These ICS devices are not shown on the map. Instead of the devices, an internet cloud appears on the map. The IP addresses of these devices are included in the cloud image. Another indication of the same problem is when multiple internet-related alerts appear. Fix the issue as follows:

1. Right-click the cloud icon on the device map and select **Export IP Addresses**.
1. Copy the public ranges that are private, and add them to the subnet list. Learn more about [configuring subnets](how-to-control-what-traffic-is-monitored.md#configure-subnets).
1. Generate a new data-mining report for internet connections.
1. In the data-mining report, enter the administrator mode and delete the IP addresses of your ICS devices.

### Clearing sensor data

In cases where the sensor needs to be relocated or erased, all learned data can be cleared from the sensor.

For more information on how to clear system data, see [Clearing sensor data](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#clearing-sensor-data).

### Export logs from the sensor console for troubleshooting

For further troubleshooting, you may want to export logs to send to the support team, such as database or operating system logs.

**To export log data**:

1. In the sensor console, go to **System settings** > **Sensor management** > **Backup & restore** > **Backup**.

1. In the **Export Troubleshooting Information** dialog:

    1. In the **File Name** field, enter a meaningful name for the exported log. The default filename uses the current date, such as **13:10-June-14-2022.tar.gz**.

    1. Select the logs you would like to export.

    1. Select **Export**.

    The file is exported and is linked from the **Archived Files** list at the bottom of the **Export Troubleshooting Information** dialog.
    
    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/export-logs-sensor.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the export troubleshooting information dialog in the sensor console. " lightbox="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/export-logs-sensor.png":::

1. Select the file link to download the exported log, and also select the :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/eye-icon.png" border="false"::: button to view its one-time password.

1. To open the exported logs, forward the downloaded file and the one-time password to the support team. Exported logs can be opened only together with the Microsoft support team.

    To keep your logs secure, make sure to forward the password separately from the downloaded log.

> [!NOTE]
> Support ticket diagnostics can be downloaded from the sensor console and then uploaded directly to the support team in the Azure portal. For more information on downloading diagnostic logs, see [Download a diagnostics log for support](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#download-a-diagnostics-log-for-support).

## Troubleshoot an on-premises management console

### Investigate a lack of expected alerts

If you don't see an expected alert on the on-premises **Alerts** page, do the following to troubleshoot:

- Verify whether the alert is already listed as a reaction to a different security instance. If it has, and that alert hasn't yet been handled, a new alert isn't shown elsewhere.

- Verify that the alert isn't being excluded by **Alert Exclusion** rules. For more information, see [Create alert exclusion rules on an on-premises management console](how-to-accelerate-alert-incident-response.md#create-alert-exclusion-rules-on-an-on-premises-management-console).

### Tweak the Quality of Service (QoS)

To save your network resources, you can limit the number of alerts sent to external systems (such as emails or SIEM) in one sync operation between an appliance and the on-premises management console.

The default is 50. This means that in one communication session between an appliance and the on-premises management console, there will be no more than 50 alerts to external systems.

To limit the number of alerts, use the `notifications.max_number_to_report` property available in `/var/cyberx/properties/management.properties`. No restart is needed after you change this property.

**To tweak the Quality of Service (QoS)**:

1. Sign in as a Defender for IoT user.

1. Verify the default values:

   ```bash
   grep \"notifications\" /var/cyberx/properties/management.properties
   ```

   The following default values appear:

   ```bash
   notifications.max_number_to_report=50
   notifications.max_time_to_report=10 (seconds)
   ```

1. Edit the default settings:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /var/cyberx/properties/management.properties
   ```

1. Edit the settings of the following lines:

   ```bash
   notifications.max_number_to_report=50
   notifications.max_time_to_report=10 (seconds)
   ```

1. Save the changes. No restart is required.

### Export logs from the on-premises management console for troubleshooting

For further troubleshooting, you may want to export logs to send to the support team, such as audit or database logs.

**To export log data**:

1. In the on-premises management console, select **System Settings > Export**.

1. In the **Export Troubleshooting Information** dialog:

    1. In the **File Name** field, enter a meaningful name for the exported log. The default filename uses the current date, such as **13:10-June-14-2022.tar.gz**.

    1. Select the logs you would like to export.

    1. Select **Export**.

    The file is exported and is linked from the **Archived Files** list at the bottom of the **Export Troubleshooting Information** dialog.

    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/export-logs-on-premises-management-console.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Export Troubleshooting Information dialog in the on-premises management console." lightbox="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/export-logs-on-premises-management-console.png":::

1. Select the file link to download the exported log, and also select the :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console/eye-icon.png" border="false"::: button to view its one-time password.

1. To open the exported logs, forward the downloaded file and the one-time password to the support team. Exported logs can be opened only together with the Microsoft support team.

    To keep your logs secure, make sure to forward the password separately from the downloaded log.
