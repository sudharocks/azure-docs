# Activate and set up your sensor

This article describes how to activate a sensor and perform initial setup.

Administrator users carry out activation when signing in for the first time and when activation management is required. Setup ensures that the sensor is configured to optimally detect and alert.

Security analysts and read-only users can't activate a sensor or generate a new password.

## Sign in and activation for administrator users

Administrators who sign in for the first time should verify that they have access to the activation and password recovery files for this sensor. These files were downloaded during sensor onboarding. If Administrators don't have these files, they can  generate new ones via Defender for IoT in the Azure portal. The following Azure permissions are needed to generate the files:

- Azure security administrator
- Subscription contributor
- Subscription owner permissions

### First-time sign in and activation checklist

Before signing in to the sensor console, administrator users should have access to:

- The sensor IP address that was defined during the installation.

- User sign in credentials for the sensor. If you downloaded an ISO for the sensor, use the default credentials that you received during the installation. We recommend that you create a new *Administrator* user after activation.

- An initial password. If you purchased a preconfigured sensor from Arrow, you need to generate a password when signing in for the first time.

- The activation file associated with this sensor. The file was generated and downloaded during sensor onboarding by Defender for IoT.


- An SSL/TLS CA-signed certificate that your company requires.

[!INCLUDE [root-of-trust](includes/root-of-trust.md)]

### About activation files

Your sensor was onboarded to Microsoft Defender for IoT in a specific management mode:

| Mode type | Description |
|--|--|
| **Cloud connected mode** | Information that the sensor detects is displayed in the sensor console. Alert information is also delivered to Azure and can be shared with other Azure services, such as Microsoft Sentinel. You can also enable automatic threat intelligence updates. |
| **Locally connected mode** | Information that the sensor detects is displayed in the sensor console. Detection information is also shared with the on-premises management console, if the sensor is connected to it. |

A locally connected, or cloud-connected activation file was generated and downloaded for this sensor during onboarding. The activation file contains instructions for the management mode of the sensor. *A unique activation file should be uploaded to each sensor you deploy.*  The first time you sign in, you need to upload the relevant activation file for this sensor.

### About certificates

Following sensor installation, a local self-signed certificate is generated. The certificate is used to access the sensor console. After administrators sign in to the console for the first time, they're  prompted to onboard an SSL/TLS certificate.

Two levels of security are available:

- Meet specific certificate and encryption requirements requested by your organization, by uploading the CA-signed certificate.
- Allow validation between the management console and connected sensors. Validation is evaluated against a certificate revocation list and the certificate expiration date. *If validation fails, communication between the management console and the sensor is halted and a validation error appears in the console.* This option is enabled by default after installation.  

The console supports the following certificate types:

- Private and Enterprise Key Infrastructure (private PKI)

- Public Key Infrastructure (public PKI)

- Locally generated on the appliance (locally self-signed) 

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > We recommend that you don't use the default self-signed certificate. The certificate is not secure and should be used for test environments only. The owner of the certificate can't be validated, and the security of your system can't be maintained. Never use this option for production networks.

For more information about working with certificates, see [Manage certificates](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#manage-certificates).

### Sign in and activate the sensor

**To sign in and activate:**

1. Go to the sensor console from your browser by using the IP defined during the installation. The sign-in dialog box opens.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-activate-and-set-up-your-sensor/sensor-log-in-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Defender for IoT sensor sign-in page.":::


1. Enter the credentials defined during the sensor installation, or select the **Password recovery** option. If you purchased a preconfigured sensor from Arrow, generate a password first. For more information on password recovery, see [Investigate password failure at initial sign-in](how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console.md#investigate-password-failure-at-initial-sign-in).


1. Select **Login/Next**.  The **Sensor Network Settings** tab opens.

1. Enable the **Import trusted CA certificate (recommended)** toggle.
1. Define a certificate name.
1. Upload the Key, CRT, and PEM files.
1. Enter a passphrase and upload a PEM file if necessary.
1. It's recommended to select **Enable certificate validation** to validate the connections between management console and connected sensors.

1. Select **Finish**.  

You might need to refresh your screen after uploading the CA-signed certificate.

For information about uploading a new certificate, supported certificate parameters, and working with CLI certificate commands, see [Manage individual sensors](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md).

### Activation expirations

After activating a sensor, you'll need to apply new activation files as follows:

|Location  |Activation process  |
|---------|---------|
|**Cloud-connected sensors**     | Cloud-connected sensors remain activated for as long as your Azure subscription with your Defender for IoT plan is active. <br><br>However, you'll also need to apply a new activation file when [updating your sensor software](update-ot-software.md#download-and-apply-a-new-activation-file) from a legacy version to version 22.2.x.        |
|  **Locally managed**   |   Apply a new activation file to locally managed sensors every year. After a sensor's activation file has expired, the sensor will continue to monitor your network, but you'll see a warning message when signing in to the sensor.     |

For more information, see [Manage Defender for IoT subscriptions](how-to-manage-subscriptions.md) and [Manage the on-premises management console](how-to-manage-the-on-premises-management-console.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-activate-and-set-up-your-sensor/sensor-log-in-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sensor sign-in page after the initial activation.":::

After your sign-in, the Microsoft Defender for IoT sensor console opens.

  :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-activate-and-set-up-your-sensor/initial-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the initial sensor console dashboard Overview page." lightbox="media/how-to-activate-and-set-up-your-sensor/initial-dashboard.png":::

## Initial setup and learning (for administrators)

After your first sign-in, the Microsoft Defender for IoT sensor starts to monitor your network automatically. Network devices will appear in the device map and device inventory sections. Microsoft Defender for IoT will begin to detect and alert you on all security and operational incidents that occur in your network. You can then create reports and queries based on the detected information.

Initially this activity is carried out in the Learning mode, which instructs your sensor to learn your network's usual activity. For example, the sensor learns devices discovered in your network, protocols detected in the network, and file transfers that occur between specific devices. This activity becomes your network's baseline activity.

### Review and update basic system settings

Review the sensor's system settings to make sure the sensor is configured to optimally detect and alert.

Define the sensor's system settings. For example:

- Define ICS (or IoT) and segregated subnets.

- Define port aliases for site-specific protocols.

- Define VLANs and names that are in use.

- If DHCP is in use, define legitimate DHCP ranges.

- Define integration with Active Directory and mail server as appropriate.

### Disable Learning mode

After adjusting the system settings, you can let the sensor run in Learning mode until you feel that system detections accurately reflect your network activity.

The learning mode should run for about 2 to 6 weeks, depending on your network size and complexity. After you disable Learning mode, any activity that differs from your baseline activity will trigger an alert.

**To disable learning mode:**

- Select **System Settings**, **Network Monitoring,**  **Detection Engines and Network Modeling** and disable the **Learning** toggle.

## First-time sign in for security analysts and read-only users

Before you sign in, verify that you have:

- The sensor IP address.
- Sign in credentials that your administrator provided.
