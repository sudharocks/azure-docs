| Planned change | Estimated date for change |
|--|--|

### Recommendation to find vulnerabilities in running container images to be released for General Availability (GA)

**Estimated date for change: February 2023**

The [Running container images should have vulnerability findings resolved](defender-for-containers-vulnerability-assessment-azure.md#view-vulnerabilities-for-images-running-on-your-aks-clusters) recommendation is currently in preview. While a recommendation is in preview, it doesn't render a resource unhealthy and isn't included in the calculations of your secure score.

We recommend that you use the recommendation to remediate vulnerabilities in your containers. Remediating the recommendation won't affect your secure score when the recommendation is released as GA. Learn about [recommendation remediation](implement-security-recommendations.md).

### The built-in policy \[Preview]: Private endpoint should be configured for Key Vault is set to be deprecated

**Estimated date for change: February 2023**

The built-in policy [`[Preview]: Private endpoint should be configured for Key Vault`](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F5f0bc445-3935-4915-9981-011aa2b46147) is set to be deprecated and will be replaced with the [`[Preview]: Azure Key Vaults should use private link`](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fa6abeaec-4d90-4a02-805f-6b26c4d3fbe9) policy.

The related [policy definition](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f7c1b1214-f927-48bf-8882-84f0af6588b1) will also be replaced by this new policy in all standards displayed in the regulatory compliance dashboard.

### Deprecation and improvement of selected alerts for Windows and Linux Servers

**Estimated date for change: April 2023**

The security alert quality improvement process for Defender for Servers includes the deprecation of some alerts for both Windows and Linux servers. The deprecated alerts will now be sourced from and covered by Defender for Endpoint threat alerts.  

If you already have the Defender for Endpoint integration enabled, no further action is required. You may experience a decrease in your alerts volume in April 2023.

If you don't have the Defender for Endpoint integration enabled in Defender for Servers, you'll need to enable the Defender for Endpoint integration to maintain and improve your alert coverage. 

All Defender for Server customers, have full access to the Defender for Endpointâ€™s integration as a part of the [Defender for Servers plan](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md#plan-features).  

You can learn more about [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarding options](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md#enable-the-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-integration).

You can also view the [full list of alerts](alerts-reference.md#defender-for-servers-alerts-to-be-deprecated) that are set to be deprecated.
