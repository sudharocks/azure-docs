# Mount Azure Storage as a local share in App Service

::: zone pivot="code-windows"

This guide shows how to mount Azure Storage Files as a network share in Windows code (non-container) in App Service. Only [Azure Files Shares](../storage/files/storage-how-to-use-files-portal.md) and [Premium Files Shares](../storage/files/storage-how-to-create-file-share.md) are supported. The benefits of custom-mounted storage include:

- Configure persistent storage for your App Service app and manage the storage separately.
- Make static content like video and images readily available for your App Service app. 
- Write application log files or archive older application log to Azure File shares.  
- Share content across multiple apps or with other Azure services.

The following features are supported for Windows code:

- Secured access to storage accounts with [private endpoints](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints.md) and [service endpoints](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#grant-access-from-a-virtual-network) (when [VNET integration](./overview-vnet-integration.md) is used).
- Azure Files (read/write).
- Up to five mount points per app.
- Mount Azure Storage file shares using "/mounts/`<path-name>`".

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Use the [`az webapp config storage-account add`](/cli/azure/webapp/config/storage-account#az-webapp-config-storage-account-add) command. For example:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config storage-account add --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --custom-id <custom-id> --storage-type AzureFiles --share-name <share-name> --account-name <storage-account-name> --access-key "<access-key>" --mount-path <mount-path-directory>
```

::: zone pivot="container-windows"
- `--storage-type` must be `AzureFiles` for Windows containers. 
- `mount-path-directory` must be in the form `/path/to/dir` or `[C-Z]:\path\to\dir`.
::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="container-linux"
- `--storage-type` can be `AzureBlob` or `AzureFiles`. `AzureBlob` is read-only.
- `--mount-path` is the directory inside the Linux container to mount to Azure Storage. Do not use `/` (the root directory).
::: zone-end

Verify your storage is mounted by running the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config storage-account list --resource-group <resource-group> --name <app-name>
```

---

> [!NOTE]
> Adding, editing, or deleting a storage mount causes the app to be restarted. 

::: zone pivot="container-linux"

## Test the mounted storage

To validate that the Azure Storage is mounted successfully for the app:

1. [Open an SSH session](configure-linux-open-ssh-session.md) into the container.
1. In the SSH terminal, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    df –h 
    ```
1. Check if the storage share is mounted. If it's not present, there's an issue with mounting the storage share.
1. Check latency or general reachability of the storage mount with the following command:

    ```bash
    tcpping Storageaccount.file.core.windows.net 
    ```

::: zone-end

## Best practices

::: zone pivot="code-windows"

- Azure Storage mounts can be configured as a virtual directory to serve static content. To configure the virtual directory, in the left navigation click **Configuration** > **Path Mappings** > **New Virtual Application or Directory**. Set the **Physical path** to the **Mount path** defined on the Azure Storage mount.

- To avoid potential issues related to latency, place the app and the Azure Storage account in the same Azure region. Note, however, if the app and Azure Storage account are in same Azure region, and if you grant access from App Service IP addresses in the [Azure Storage firewall configuration](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md), then these IP restrictions are not honored.

- In the Azure Storage account, avoid [regenerating the access key](../storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage.md) that's used to mount the storage in the app. The storage account contains two different keys. Azure App Services stores Azure storage account key. Use a stepwise approach to ensure that the storage mount remains available to the app during key regeneration. For example, assuming that you used **key1** to configure storage mount in your app:

    1. Regenerate **key2**. 
    1. In the storage mount configuration, update the access the key to use the regenerated **key2**.
    1. Regenerate **key1**.

- If you delete an Azure Storage account, container, or share, remove the corresponding storage mount configuration in the app to avoid possible error scenarios. 

- The mounted Azure Storage account can be either Standard or Premium performance tier. Based on the app capacity and throughput requirements, choose the appropriate performance tier for the storage account. See the [scalability and performance targets for Files](../storage/files/storage-files-scale-targets.md).

- If your app [scales to multiple instances](../azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-get-started.md), all the instances connect to the same mounted Azure Storage account. To avoid performance bottlenecks and throughput issues, choose the appropriate performance tier for the storage account.  

- It's not recommended to use storage mounts for local databases (such as SQLite) or for any other applications and components that rely on file handles and locks. 

- If you [initiate a storage failover](../storage/common/storage-initiate-account-failover.md) and the storage account is mounted to the app, the mount will fail to connect until you either restart the app or remove and add the Azure Storage mount. 
 
- When VNET integration is used, ensure app setting, `WEBSITE_CONTENTOVERVNET` is set to `1` and the following ports are open:
    - Azure Files: 80 and 445

- The mounted Azure Storage account can be either Standard or Premium performance tier. Based on the app capacity and throughput requirements, choose the appropriate performance tier for the storage account. See [the scalability and performance targets for Files](../storage/files/storage-files-scale-targets.md)

- The mount directory in the custom container should be empty. Any content stored at this path is deleted when the Azure Storage is mounted (if you specify a directory under `/home`, for example). If you are migrating files for an existing app, make a backup of the app and its content before you begin.

- Mounting the storage to `/home` is not recommended because it may result in performance bottlenecks for the app.
