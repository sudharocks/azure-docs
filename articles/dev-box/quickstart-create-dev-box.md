# Quickstart: Create a dev box by using the developer portal

Get started with Microsoft Dev Box Preview by creating a dev box through the developer portal. After creating the dev box, you connect to it with a remote desktop (RD) session through a browser, or through a remote desktop app. 

You can create and manage multiple dev boxes as a dev box user. Create a dev box for each task that you're working on, and create multiple dev boxes within a single project to help streamline your workflow. 

In this quickstart, you will:

* [Create a dev box](#create-a-dev-box)
* [Connect to a dev box](#connect-to-a-dev-box)

## Prerequisites

- Permissions as a [Dev Box User](./quickstart-configure-dev-box-service.md#provide-access-to-a-dev-box-project) for a project that has an available dev box pool. If you don't have permissions to a project, contact your administrator.

## Create a dev box

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal).

## Connect to a dev box
Once you've provisioned your dev box, you can access it in multiple ways. 

### Browser

For quick access in a browser tab, the developer portal links directly to a browser session through which you can connect to and use your dev box.

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal).

1. To connect to a dev box, select **Open in browser**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-create-dev-box/dev-portal-card-rdp.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dev box card showing the Open in browser option.":::

A new tab will open with an RD session to your dev box.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can delete your dev box.
1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal).

1. For the dev box you want to delete, from the setting menu, select **Delete**.
