# Quickstart: Configure the Microsoft Dev Box Preview service

This quickstart describes how to configure the Microsoft Dev Box service by using the Azure portal to enable development teams to self-serve dev boxes. 

This quickstart will take you through the process of setting up your Dev Box environment. You'll create a dev center to organize your dev box resources, configure network components to enable dev boxes to connect to your organizational resources, and create a dev box definition that will form the basis of your dev boxes. Youâ€™ll then create a project and a dev box pool, which work together to help you give access to users who will manage or use the dev boxes.

After you've completed this quickstart, you'll have a Dev Box configuration ready for users to create and connect to dev boxes.

## Prerequisites

To complete this quick start, make sure that you have:
- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- Owner or Contributor permissions on an Azure Subscription or a specific resource group.
- Network Contributor permissions on an existing virtual network (owner or contributor) or permission to create a new virtual network and subnet.
- User licenses. To use Dev Box, each user must be licensed for Windows 11 Enterprise or Windows 10 Enterprise, Microsoft Intune, and Azure Active Directory P1. 
    - These licenses are available independently and also included in the following subscriptions: 
       - Microsoft 365 F3 
       - Microsoft 365 E3, Microsoft 365 E5 
       - Microsoft 365 A3, Microsoft 365 A5
       - Microsoft 365 Business Premium
       - Microsoft 365 Education Student Use Benefit 
- [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/) allows you to use your Windows licenses on Azure with Dev Box.

## Create a network connection

Network connections determine the region into which dev boxes are deployed and allow them to be connected to your existing virtual networks. The following steps show you how to create and configure a network connection in Microsoft Dev Box.  

To create a network connection, you must have:

- An existing virtual network (vnet) and subnet. If you don't have a vnet and subnet available, follow the instructions here: [Create a virtual network and subnet](#create-a-virtual-network-and-subnet) to create them.
- A configured and working Hybrid AD join or Azure AD join.
    - **Azure AD join:** To learn how to join devices directly to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), see [Plan your Azure Active Directory join deployment](../active-directory/devices/azureadjoin-plan.md).
    - **Hybrid AD join:** To learn how to join your AD DS domain-joined computers to Azure AD from an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment, see [Plan your hybrid Azure Active Directory join deployment](../active-directory/devices/hybrid-azuread-join-plan.md).
- If your organization routes egress traffic through a firewall, you need to open certain ports to allow the Dev Box service to function. For more information, see [Network requirements](/windows-365/enterprise/requirements-network).

### Create a virtual network and subnet

You must have a vnet and subnet available for your network connection; create them using these steps:

## Project admins

The Microsoft Dev Box service makes it possible for you to delegate administration of projects to a member of the project team. Project administrators can assist with the day-to-day management of projects for their team, like creating and managing dev box pools. To provide users permissions to manage projects, add them to the DevCenter Project Admin role. 

You can assign the DevCenter Project Admin role by using the [Provide access to a dev box project](#provide-access-to-a-dev-box-project) steps, but selecting the Project Admin role instead of the Dev Box User role. For more information, go to [Provide access to projects for project admins](how-to-project-admin.md).

[!INCLUDE [permissions note](./includes/note-permission-to-create-dev-box.md)]
## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a dev box project and the resources necessary to support it. You created a dev center, added a network connection, created a dev box definition, and a project. You then created a dev box pool within an existing project and assigned a user permission to create dev boxes based on the new pool.
