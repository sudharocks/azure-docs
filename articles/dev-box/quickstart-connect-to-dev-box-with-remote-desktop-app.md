# Quickstart: Use a remote desktop client to connect to a dev box
When you have configured the Microsoft Dev Box Preview service and created dev boxes, you can connect to them using a browser, or by using a remote desktop client.

Remote desktop apps let you use and control a dev box from almost any device. For your desktop or laptop, you can choose to download the Remote Desktop client for Windows Desktop or the Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac. You can also download a Remote Desktop app for your mobile device: Microsoft Remote Desktop for iOS or Microsoft Remote Desktop for Android.

In this quickstart, you'll perform the following tasks:

* Download the Remote Desktop client (Windows and non-Windows).
* Use the Remote Desktop client to connect to a dev box.

## Prerequisites

## Clean up resources

Dev boxes incur costs whenever they are running. When you have finished using your dev box, shutdown or stop it to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.

You can stop a dev box from the developer portal:

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal).

1. For the dev box you want to stop, select the Actions menu, and then select **Stop**.

1. The dev box may take a few moments to stop.
