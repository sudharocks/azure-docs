# How to create copies of the MedTech service device and FHIR destination mappings

This article provides steps for creating copies of your MedTech service's device and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;) destination mappings that can be used outside of Azure. These copies can be used for editing, troubleshooting, and archiving.

> [!TIP]
> Check out the [IoMT Connector Data Mapper](https://github.com/microsoft/iomt-fhir/tree/master/tools/data-mapper) tool for editing, testing, and troubleshooting MedTech service device and FHIR destination mappings. Export mappings for uploading to the MedTech service in the Azure portal or use with the [open-source version](https://github.com/microsoft/iomt-fhir) of the MedTech service.

> [!NOTE]
> When opening an [Azure Technical Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) ticket for your MedTech service, include copies of your device and FHIR destination mappings to assist in the troubleshooting process.

## Device mappings copy creation process

1. Select **"MedTech service"** on the left side of your Azure Health Data Services workspace under **Services**.

2. Select the name of the **MedTech service** that you'll be copying the device mappings from. In this example, we'll be making a copy of the device mappings from a MedTech service named **mt-azuredocsdemo**. You'll be selecting your own MedTech service as part of this process.

3. Select the **Device mapping** button under **Settings**.

   > [!TIP]
   > This process can also be used for copying and saving the contents of the also know as the FHIR destination mappings found in **Destination** which is also under **Settings** within your MedTech service.

4. Select the contents of the device mappings (for example: press **Ctrl + a**) and do a copy operation (for example: press **Ctrl + c**).

5. Open an editor application like Notepad or [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and do a paste operation (for example: press **Ctrl + v**) and a save operation (for example: press **Ctrl + s**) to create a file copy of your MedTech service device mappings. For this example, we'll be using Notepad. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/iot-mappings-copies/iot-mappings-copies-save-in-notepad.png" alt-text="Screenshot of using Notepad with the device mappings copy." lightbox="media/iot-mappings-copies/iot-mappings-copies-save-in-notepad.png":::

   1. Select a folder to save the file in.
   2. Select a name for your file.
   3. Leave the remaining fields at their defaults (for example: **Save as type** and **Encoding**). 
   4. Select the **Save** button.
