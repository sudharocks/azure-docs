# How to use IotJsonPathContentTemplate mappings

This article describes how to use IoTJsonPathContentTemplate mappings with the MedTech service [device mapping](how-to-configure-device-mappings.md).

## IotJsonPathContentTemplate

The IotJsonPathContentTemplate is similar to the JsonPathContentTemplate except the `DeviceIdExpression` and `TimestampExpression` aren't required.

The assumption, when using this template, is the messages being evaluated were sent using the [Azure IoT Hub Device SDKs](../../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-sdks.md#azure-iot-hub-device-sdks) or  [Export Data (legacy)](../../iot-central/core/howto-export-data-legacy.md) feature of [Azure IoT Central](../../iot-central/core/overview-iot-central.md). 

When you're using these SDKs, the device identity and the timestamp of the message are known.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you're using a device identifier from Azure Iot Hub or Azure IoT Central that is registered as an identifier for a device resource on the destination Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR&#174;) service.

If you're using Azure IoT Hub Device SDKs, you can still use the JsonPathContentTemplate, assuming that you're using custom properties in the message body for the device identity or measurement timestamp.

> [!NOTE]
> When using `IotJsonPathContentTemplate`, the `TypeMatchExpression` should resolve to the entire message as a JToken. For more information, see the following examples:

### Examples

With each of these examples, you're provided with:
 * A valid IoT device message.
 * An example of what the IoT device message will look like after being received and processed by the IoT Hub.
 * A valid MedTech service device mapping for normalizing the IoT device message after IoT Hub processing.
 * An example of what the MedTech service device message will look like after normalization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To avoid device spoofing in device-to-cloud messages, Azure IoT Hub enriches all messages with additional properties. To learn more about these properties, see [Anti-spoofing properties](../../iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-construct.md#anti-spoofing-properties).

> [!TIP]
> [Visual Studio Code with the Azure IoT Hub extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-toolkit) is a recommended method for sending IoT device messages to your IoT Hub for testing and troubleshooting.

**Heart rate**

**A valid IoT device message to send to your IoT Hub.**

```json

{“heartRate” : “78”}

```

**An example of what the IoT device message will look like after being received and processed by the IoT Hub.**

> [!NOTE]
> The IoT Hub enriches the device message before sending it to the MedTech service device event hub with all properties starting with `iothub`. For example: `iothub-creation-time-utc`.
>
> `patientIdExpression` is only required for MedTech services in the **Create** mode, however, if **Lookup** is being used, a Device resource with a matching Device Identifier must exist in the FHIR service. These examples assume your MedTech service is in a **Create** mode. For more information on the **Create** and **Lookup** **Destination properties**, see [Configure Destination properties](deploy-05-new-config.md#destination-properties). 

```json

{
   "Body": {
   "heartRate": "78"        
    },
    "Properties": {
        "iothub-creation-time-utc" : "2021-02-01T22:46:01.8750000Z"
    },
    "SystemProperties": {
        "iothub-connection-device-id" : "device123"
   }
}     

```

**A valid MedTech service device mapping for normalizing the IoT device message after IoT Hub processing.**

```json

{
    "templateType": "CollectionContent",
    "template": [
      {
        "templateType": "IotJsonPathContentTemplate",
        "template": {
        "typeName": "heartRate",
        "typeMatchExpression": "$..[?(@Body.heartRate)]",
        "patientIdExpression": "$.SystemProperties.iothub-connection-device-id", 
        "values": [
          {  
             "required": "true",
             "valueExpression": "$.Body.heartRate",
             "valueName": "hr"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}  

```

**An example of what the MedTech service device message will look like after the normalization process.**

```json

{
   "type": "heartRate",
   "occurrenceTimeUtc": "2021-02-01T22:46:01.875Z",
   "deviceId": "device123",
   "properties": [
      {
         "name": "hr",
         "value": "78"
      }
   ]
}

```

**Blood pressure**

**A valid IoT device message to send to your IoT Hub.**

```json

{
  "systolic": "123",
  "diastolic": "87"
}

```

**An example of what the IoT device message will look like after being received and processed by the IoT Hub.**

> [!NOTE]

> [!TIP]
> The IotJsonPathTemplate device mapping examples provided in this article may be combined into a single MedTech service device mapping as shown below.
>
> Additionally, the IotJasonPathTemplates can also be combined with with other template types such as [JasonPathContentTemplate mappings](how-to-use-jsonpath-content-mappings.md) to further expand your MedTech service device mapping.
