# Download a blob with .NET

This article shows how to download a blob using the [Azure Storage client library for .NET](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/storage). You can download a blob by using any of the following methods:

- [DownloadTo](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.specialized.blobbaseclient.downloadto)
- [DownloadToAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.specialized.blobbaseclient.downloadtoasync)
- [DownloadContent](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.specialized.blobbaseclient.downloadcontent)
- [DownloadContentAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.specialized.blobbaseclient.downloadcontentasync)

You can also open a stream to read from a blob. The stream will only download the blob as the stream is read from. Use either of the following methods:

- [OpenRead](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.specialized.blobbaseclient.openread)
- [OpenReadAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.specialized.blobbaseclient.openreadasync)

> [!NOTE]
> The examples in this article assume that you've created a [BlobServiceClient](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.blobserviceclient) object by using the guidance in the [Get started with Azure Blob Storage and .NET](storage-blob-dotnet-get-started.md) article.  
 
## Download to a file path

The following example downloads a blob by using a file path. If the specified directory does not exist, handle the exception and notify the user.

```csharp
public static async Task DownloadBlob(BlobClient blobClient, string localFilePath)
{
    try
    {
        await blobClient.DownloadToAsync(localFilePath);
    }
    catch (DirectoryNotFoundException ex)
    {
        // Let the user know that the directory does not exist
        Console.WriteLine($"Directory not found: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

If the file already exists at `localFilePath`, it will be overwritten by default during subsequent downloads.

## Download to a stream

The following example downloads a blob by creating a [Stream](/dotnet/api/system.io.stream) object and then downloads to that stream. If the specified directory does not exist, handle the exception and notify the user.

```csharp
public static async Task DownloadToStream(BlobClient blobClient, string localFilePath)
{
    try
    {
        FileStream fileStream = File.OpenWrite(localFilePath);
        await blobClient.DownloadToAsync(fileStream);
        fileStream.Close();
    }
    catch (DirectoryNotFoundException ex)
    {
        // Let the user know that the directory does not exist
        Console.WriteLine($"Directory not found: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

## Download to a string

The following example downloads a blob to a string. This example assumes that the blob is a text file.  

```csharp
public static async Task DownloadToText(BlobClient blobClient)
{
    BlobDownloadResult downloadResult = await blobClient.DownloadContentAsync();
    string downloadedData = downloadResult.Content.ToString();
    Console.WriteLine("Downloaded data:", downloadedData);
}
```

## Download from a stream

The following example downloads a blob by reading from a stream. 

```csharp
public static async Task DownloadfromStream(BlobClient blobClient, string localFilePath)
{
    using (var stream = await blobClient.OpenReadAsync())
    {
        FileStream fileStream = File.OpenWrite(localFilePath);
        await stream.CopyToAsync(fileStream);
    }
}

```
