# Authorize access to blob data with managed identities for Azure resources

Azure Blob Storage supports Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication with [managed identities for Azure resources](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md). Managed identities for Azure resources can authorize access to blob data using Azure AD credentials from applications running in Azure virtual machines (VMs), function apps, virtual machine scale sets, and other services. By using managed identities for Azure resources together with Azure AD authentication, you can avoid storing credentials with your applications that run in the cloud.

This article shows how to authorize access to blob data from an Azure VM using managed identities for Azure Resources.

## Enable managed identities on a VM

Before you can use managed identities for Azure Resources to authorize access to blobs from your VM, you must first enable managed identities for Azure Resources on the VM. To learn how to enable managed identities for Azure Resources, see one of these articles:

- [Azure portal](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm.md)
- [Azure PowerShell](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-powershell-windows-vm.md)
- [Azure CLI](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-cli-windows-vm.md)
- [Azure Resource Manager template](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-template-windows-vm.md)
- [Azure Resource Manager client libraries](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-sdk-windows-vm.md)

For more information about managed identities, see [Managed identities for Azure resources](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).

## Assign an RBAC role to a managed identity

When an Azure AD security principal attempts to access data in an Azure Storage account, that security principal must have permissions to the data resource. Whether the security principal is a managed identity in Azure or an Azure AD user account running code in the development environment, the security principal must be assigned an Azure role that grants access to data in Azure Storage. For information about assigning permissions for data access via Azure RBAC, see [Assign an Azure role for access to blob data](assign-azure-role-data-access.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When you create an Azure Storage account, you are not automatically assigned permissions to access data via Azure AD. You must explicitly assign yourself an Azure role for Azure Storage. You can assign it at the level of your subscription, resource group, storage account, or container.

## Use a managed identity to create a block blob in .NET

The Azure Identity client library simplifies the process of getting an OAuth 2.0 access token for authorization with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) via the [Azure SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk). When you use the Azure Identity client library to get an access token, you can use the same code to acquire the token whether your application is running in the development environment or in Azure. For more information, see [Use the Azure Identity library to get an access token for authorization](../common/identity-library-acquire-token.md).

To get a token that your code can use to authorize requests to Azure Storage, create an instance of the [DefaultAzureCredential](/dotnet/api/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential) class. You can then use the token to create a service client object that is authorized to perform data operations in Azure Storage. For more information about using the **DefaultAzureCredential** class to authorize a managed identity to access Azure Storage, see [Azure Identity client library for .NET](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme).

For this code sample to work properly, first assign the [Storage Blob Data Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor) role to the security principal. This built-in role provides read and write access to blob data in your storage account.

The following code example shows how to get an access token and use it to create a service client object, then uses the service client to upload a new blob:

```csharp
async static Task CreateBlockBlobAsync(string accountName, string containerName, string blobName)
{
    // Construct the blob container endpoint from the arguments.
    string containerEndpoint = string.Format("https://{0}.blob.core.windows.net/{1}",
                                                accountName,
                                                containerName);

    // Get a credential and create a service client object for the blob container.
    BlobContainerClient containerClient = new BlobContainerClient(new Uri(containerEndpoint),
                                                                    new DefaultAzureCredential());

    try
    {
        // Create the container if it does not exist.
        await containerClient.CreateIfNotExistsAsync();

        // Upload text to a new block blob.
        string blobContents = "This is a block blob.";
        byte[] byteArray = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(blobContents);

        using (MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream(byteArray))
        {
            await containerClient.UploadBlobAsync(blobName, stream);
        }
    }
    catch (RequestFailedException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
        Console.ReadLine();
        throw;
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> To authorize requests against blob data with Azure AD, you must use HTTPS for those requests.
