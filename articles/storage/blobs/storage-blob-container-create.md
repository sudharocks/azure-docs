# Create a blob container with .NET

Blobs in Azure Storage are organized into containers. Before you can upload a blob, you must first create a container. This article shows how to create containers with the [Azure Storage client library for .NET](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/storage).

> [!NOTE]
> The examples in this article assume that you've created a [BlobServiceClient](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.blobserviceclient) object by using the guidance in the [Get started with Azure Blob Storage and .NET](storage-blob-dotnet-get-started.md) article.

## Name a container

A container name must be a valid DNS name, as it forms part of the unique URI used to address the container or its blobs. Follow these rules when naming a container:

- Container names can be between 3 and 63 characters long.
- Container names must start with a letter or number, and can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.
- Two or more consecutive dash characters aren't permitted in container names.

The URI for a container is in this format:

`https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer`

## Create a container

To create a container, call one of the following methods from the `BlobServiceClient` class:

- [CreateBlobContainer](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.blobserviceclient.createblobcontainer)
- [CreateBlobContainerAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.blobserviceclient.createblobcontainerasync)

You can also create a container using one of the following methods from the `BlobContainerClient` class:

- [Create](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.blobcontainerclient.create)
- [CreateAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.blobcontainerclient.createasync)

These methods throw an exception if a container with the same name already exists.

Containers are created immediately beneath the storage account. It's not possible to nest one container beneath another.

The following example uses a `BlobServiceClient` object to create a container asynchronously:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/dotnet/dotnet-v12/Containers.cs" id="CreateSampleContainerAsync":::

## Create the root container

A root container serves as a default container for your storage account. Each storage account may have one root container, which must be named *$root*. The root container must be explicitly created or deleted.

You can reference a blob stored in the root container without including the root container name. The root container enables you to reference a blob at the top level of the storage account hierarchy. For example, you can reference a blob that is in the root container in the following manner:

`https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/default.html`

The following example creates the root container synchronously:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/dotnet/dotnet-v12/Containers.cs" id="CreateRootContainer":::
