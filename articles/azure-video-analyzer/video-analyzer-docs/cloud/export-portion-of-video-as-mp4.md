# Tutorial: Export portion of recorded video as an MP4 file

[!INCLUDE [header](includes/cloud-env.md)]

[!INCLUDE [deprecation notice](../includes/deprecation-notice.md)]

In this tutorial, you learn how to export a portion of video that has been recorded in Azure Video Analyzer account. This exported portion of video is saved as an MP4 file which can be downloaded and consumed outside of the Video Analyzer account.

The topic demonstrates how to export a portion of the video using the Azure portal and a C# SDK code sample.

## Suggested pre-reading  

Read these articles before you begin:

* [Azure Video Analyzer overview](../overview.md)
* [Video Analyzer Pipeline concepts](../pipeline.md)

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites for this tutorial are:

* An Azure account that includes an active subscription. [Create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) for free if you don't already have one.
* [Video Analyzer account](../create-video-analyzer-account.md).
* Have completed [Quickstart: Detect motion in a (simulated) live video, record the video to the Video Analyzer account](../edge/detect-motion-record-video-clips-cloud.md) or any Video Analyzer pipeline that records to a video sink.

## Overview

Video Analyzer can record videos from an RTSP source. These videos are recorded in a segmented archive and stored in the Video Analyzer account. The segmented archive format allows unbounded duration of video recording. However, in some cases it is necessary to save a portion of video as an MP4 so that it can be individually archived, downloaded, or played outside of the Video Analyzer ecosystem.

In this tutorial, you will learn:

* About batch pipeline topologies and batch pipeline jobs.
* How to create a batch topology.
* How to create a batch pipeline job from a Video Analyzer video archive. The new video archive creates an MP4 file that contains a specified value of time (up to 24 hours).

## Pipeline topology of **batch** kind

A pipeline topology of batch kind enables you to describe how recorded video should be processed for export. The topology is based on your custom needs through three interconnected nodes. A pipeline topology of batch kind is the base that is used for pipeline jobs. A pipeline job is the individual instance of a pipeline topology of batch kind. The pipeline job imports the recorded Video Analyzer video and saves it to the Video Analyzer's storage account, as a downloadable MP4 file. The pipeline topology of batch kind uses a [video source node](../pipeline.md#video-source) that connects to an [encoder processor node](../pipeline.md#encoder-processor) and then connects to a [video sink node](../pipeline.md#video-sink).

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about sources, processors, and sinks, see [sources, processors, and sinks](../pipeline.md#sources-processors-and-sinks). For more information on pipeline jobs, see [pipeline jobs](../pipeline.md#batch-pipeline)
