# Export test results from Azure Load Testing for use in third-party tools

In this article, you'll learn how to download the test results from Azure Load Testing in the Azure portal. You might use these results for reporting in third-party tools.

The test results contain comma-separated values (CSV) file(s) with details of each application request. See [Apache JMeter CSV log format](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/listeners.html#csvlogformat) and the [Apache JMeter Glossary](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/glossary.html) for details about the different fields.

You can also use the test results to diagnose errors during a load test. The `responseCode` and `responseMessage` fields give you more information about failed requests. For more information about investigating errors, see [Troubleshoot test execution errors](./how-to-find-download-logs.md).

You can generate the Apache JMeter dashboard from the CSV log file following the steps mentioned [here](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/generating-dashboard.html#report).

## Prerequisites  

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.  
- An Azure Load Testing resource that has a completed test run. If you need to create an Azure Load Testing resource, see [Create and run a load test](./quickstart-create-and-run-load-test.md).  

## Access and download load test results

In this section, you'll retrieve and download the Azure Load Testing results file from the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your Azure Load Testing resource.

1. On the left pane, select **Tests** to view a list of tests, and then select your test.

   >[!TIP]
   > To limit the number of tests to display in the list, you can use the search box and the **Time range** filter.

1. You can download the test results file as a zipped folder in either of two ways:

   * Select the ellipsis (**...**) next to the load test run you're working with, and then select **Download results file**.

     > [!NOTE]
     > A load test run needs to have a *Done*, *Stopped*, or *Failed* status for the results file to be available for download.

   * On the **Test run details** pane, select **Download**, and then select **Results**.

1. You can use any zip tool to extract the folder and access the test results.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-export-test-results/test-results-zip.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the test results zip file in the downloads list.":::  

    The folder contains a separate CSV file for every test engine and contains details of requests that the test engine executed during the load test.
