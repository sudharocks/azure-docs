# Troubleshoot load test errors by downloading Apache JMeter logs

Learn how to diagnose and troubleshoot errors while running a load test with Azure Load Testing. Download the Apache JMeter worker logs or load test results for detailed logging information.

When you start a load test, the Azure Load Testing test engines run your Apache JMeter script. Errors can occur at different levels. For example, during the execution of the JMeter script, while connecting to the application endpoint, or in the test engine instance.

You can use different sources of information to diagnose these errors:

- [Download the Apache JMeter worker logs](#download-apache-jmeter-worker-logs) to investigate issues with JMeter and the test script execution.
- [Export the load test result](./how-to-export-test-results.md) and analyze the response code and response message of each HTTP request.

There might also be problems with the application endpoint itself. If you host the application on Azure, you can [configure server-side monitoring](./how-to-monitor-server-side-metrics.md) to get detailed insights about the application components.

## Load test error indicators

After running a load test, there are multiple error indicators available:

- The test run **Status** information is **Failed**.

- The test run statistics shows a non-zero **Error percentage** value.
- The **Errors** graph in the client-side metrics shows errors.

## Prerequisites  

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.  
- An Azure load testing resource that has a completed test run. If you need to create an Azure load testing resource, see [Create and run a load test](./quickstart-create-and-run-load-test.md).  

## Download Apache JMeter worker logs

When you run a load test, the Azure Load Testing test engines execute your Apache JMeter test script. During the load test, Apache JMeter stores detailed logging in the worker node logs. You can download these JMeter worker logs for each test run in the Azure portal.

For example, if there's a problem with your JMeter script, the load test status will be **Failed**. In the worker logs you might find additional information about the cause of the problem.

To download the worker logs for an Azure Load Testing test run, follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your Azure Load Testing resource.

1. Select **Tests** to view the list of tests, and then select your load test.

   >[!TIP]
   > To limit the number of tests, use the search box and the **Time range** filter.

1. Select a test run from the list to view the test run dashboard.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-find-download-logs/test-run.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a list of test runs for the selected load test.":::  

1. On the dashboard, select **Download**, and then select **Logs**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-find-download-logs/logs.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to download the test log files from the test run details page.":::  

    The browser should now start downloading the JMeter worker node log file *worker.log*.

1. You can use a text editor to open the log file.

    The *worker.log* file can help you diagnose the root cause of a failing load test. In the previous screenshot, you can see that the test failed because a file is missing.
